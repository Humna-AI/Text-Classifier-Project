"8.1 Thread State and the Global Interpreter Lock The Python interpreter is not fully thread safe . In order to support multi-threaded Python programs , there 's a global lock that must be held by the current thread before it can safely access Python objects . Without the lock , even the simplest operations could cause problems in a multi-threaded program : for example , when two threads simultaneously increment the reference count of the same object , the reference count could end up being incremented only once instead of twice . Therefore , the rule exists that only the thread that has acquired the global interpreter lock may operate on Python objects or call Python / C API functions . In order to support multi-threaded Python programs , the interpreter regularly releases and reacquires the lock -- by default , every ten bytecode instructions ( this can be changed with sys . s etcheckinterval ( )) . The lock is also released and reacquired around potentially blocking I / O operations like reading or writing a file , so that other threads can run while the thread that requests the I / O is waiting for the I / O operation to complete . The Python interpreter needs to keep some bookkeeping information separate per thread -- for this it uses a data structure called PyThreadState . This is new in Python 1.5 ; in earlier versions , such state was stored in global variables , and switching threads could cause problems . In particular , exception handling is now thread safe , when the application uses sys . e xc_info ( ) to access the exception last raised in the current thread . There 's one global variable left , however : the pointer to the current PyThreadState structure . While most thread packages have a way to store ' ' per-thread global data , ' ' Python's internal platform independent thread abstraction does n ' t support this yet . Therefore , the current thread state must be manipulated explicitly . This is easy enough in most cases . Most code manipulating the global interpreter lock has the following simple structure : Save the thread state in a local variable . Release the interpreter lock .... Do some blocking I / O operation ... Reacquire the interpreter lock . Restore the thread state from the local variable . This is so common that a pair of macros exists to simplify it : Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS ... Do some blocking I / O operation ... Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS The Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS macro opens a new block and declares a hidden local variable ; the Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS macro closes the block . Another advantage of using these two macros is that when Python is compiled without thread support , they are defined empty , thus saving the thread state and lock manipulations . When thread support is enabled , the block above expands to the following code : PyThreadState * _save ; _save = PyEval_SaveThread ( ) ; ... Do some blocking I / O operation ... PyEval_RestoreThread ( _save ) ; Using even lower level primitives , we can get roughly the same effect as follows : PyThreadState * _save ; _save = PyThreadState_Swap ( NULL ) ; PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) ; ... Do some blocking I / O operation ... PyEval_AcquireLock ( ) ; PyThreadState_Swap ( _save ) ; There are some subtle differences ; in particular , PyEval_RestoreThread ( ) saves and restores the value of the global variable errno , since the lock manipulation does not guarantee that errno is left alone . Also , when thread support is disabled , PyEval_SaveThread ( ) and PyEval_RestoreThread ( ) do n't manipulate the lock ; in this case , PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) and PyEval_AcquireLock ( ) are not available . This is done so that dynamically loaded extensions compiled with thread support enabled can be loaded by an interpreter that was compiled with disabled thread support . The global interpreter lock is used to protect the pointer to the current thread state . When releasing the lock and saving the thread state , the current thread state pointer must be retrieved before the lock is released ( since another thread could immediately acquire the lock and store its own thread state in the global variable ) . Reversely , when acquiring the lock and restoring the thread state , the lock must be acquired before storing the thread state pointer . Why am I going on with so much detail about this ? Because when threads are created from C , they do n't have the global interpreter lock , nor is there a thread state data structure for them . Such threads must bootstrap themselves into existence , by first creating a thread state data structure , then acquiring the lock , and finally storing their thread state pointer , before they can start using the Python / C API . When they are done , they should reset the thread state pointer , release the lock , and finally free their thread state data structure . When creating a thread data structure , you need to provide an interpreter state data structure . The interpreter state data structure hold global data that is shared by all threads in an interpreter , for example the module administration ( sys . m odules ) . Depending on your needs , you can either create a new interpreter state data structure , or share the interpreter state data structure used by the Python main thread ( to access the latter , you must obtain the thread state and access its interp member ; this must be done by a thread that is created by Python or by the main thread after Python is initialized ) . PyInterpreterState This data structure represents the state shared by a number of cooperating threads . Threads belonging to the same interpreter share their module administration and a few other internal items . There are no public members in this structure . Threads belonging to different interpreters initially share nothing , except process state like available memory , open file descriptors and such . The global interpreter lock is also shared by all threads , regardless of to which interpreter they belong . PyThreadState This data structure represents the state of a single thread . The only public data member is PyInterpreterState * interp , which points to this thread's interpreter state . void PyEval_InitThreads ( ) Initialize and acquire the global interpreter lock . It should be called in the main thread before creating a second thread or engaging in any other thread operations such as PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) or PyEval_ReleaseThread ( tstate ) . It is not needed before calling PyEval_SaveThread ( ) or PyEval_RestoreThread ( ) . This is a no-op when called for a second time . It is safe to call this function before calling Py_Initialize ( ) . When only the main thread exists , no lock operations are needed . This is a common situation ( most Python programs do not use threads ) , and the lock operations slow the interpreter down a bit . Therefore , the lock is not created initially . This situation is equivalent to having acquired the lock : when there is only a single thread , all object accesses are safe . Therefore , when this function initializes the lock , it also acquires it . Before the Python thread module creates a new thread , knowing that either it has the lock or the lock has n ' t been created yet , it calls PyEval_InitThreads ( ) . When this call returns , it is guaranteed that the lock has been created and that it has acquired it . It is not safe to call this function when it is unknown which thread ( if any ) currently has the global interpreter lock . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . void PyEval_AcquireLock ( ) Acquire the global interpreter lock . The lock must have been created earlier . If this thread already has the lock , a deadlock ensues . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . void PyEval_ReleaseLock ( ) Release the global interpreter lock . The lock must have been created earlier . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . void PyEval_AcquireThread ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Acquire the global interpreter lock and then set the current thread state to tstate , which should not be NULL . The lock must have been created earlier . If this thread already has the lock , deadlock ensues . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . void PyEval_ReleaseThread ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Reset the current thread state to NULL and release the global interpreter lock . The lock must have been created earlier and must be held by the current thread . The tstate argument , which must not be NULL , is only used to check that it represents the current thread state -- if it is n't , a fatal error is reported . This function is not available when thread support is disabled at compile time . PyThreadState * PyEval_SaveThread ( ) Release the interpreter lock ( if it has been created and thread support is enabled ) and reset the thread state to NULL , returning the previous thread state ( which is not NULL ) . If the lock has been created , the current thread must have acquired it . ( This function is available even when thread support is disabled at compile time . ) void PyEval_RestoreThread ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Acquire the interpreter lock ( if it has been created and thread support is enabled ) and set the thread state to tstate , which must not be NULL . If the lock has been created , the current thread must not have acquired it , otherwise deadlock ensues . ( This function is available even when thread support is disabled at compile time . ) The following macros are normally used without a trailing semicolon ; look for example usage in the Python source distribution . Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS This macro expands to "" { PyThreadState * _save ; _save = PyEval_SaveThread ( ) ; "" . Note that it contains an opening brace ; it must be matched with a following Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS macro . See above for further discussion of this macro . It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time . Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS This macro expands to "" PyEval_RestoreThread ( _save ) ; } "" . Note that it contains a closing brace ; it must be matched with an earlier Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS macro . See above for further discussion of this macro . It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time . Py_BEGIN_BLOCK_THREADS This macro expands to "" PyEval_RestoreThread ( _save ) ; "" i . e . it is equivalent to Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS without the closing brace . It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time . Py_BEGIN_UNBLOCK_THREADS This macro expands to "" _save = PyEval_SaveThread ( ) ; "" i . e . it is equivalent to Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS without the opening brace and variable declaration . It is a no-op when thread support is disabled at compile time . All of the following functions are only available when thread support is enabled at compile time , and must be called only when the interpreter lock has been created . PyInterpreterState * PyInterpreterState_New ( ) Create a new interpreter state object . The interpreter lock need not be held , but may be held if it is necessary to serialize calls to this function . void PyInterpreterState_Clear ( PyInterpreterState * interp ) Reset all information in an interpreter state object . The interpreter lock must be held . void PyInterpreterState_Delete ( PyInterpreterState * interp ) Destroy an interpreter state object . The interpreter lock need not be held . The interpreter state must have been reset with a previous call to PyInterpreterState_Clear ( ) . PyThreadState * PyThreadState_New ( PyInterpreterState * interp ) Create a new thread state object belonging to the given interpreter object . The interpreter lock need not be held , but may be held if it is necessary to serialize calls to this function . void PyThreadState_Clear ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Reset all information in a thread state object . The interpreter lock must be held . void PyThreadState_Delete ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Destroy a thread state object . The interpreter lock need not be held . The thread state must have been reset with a previous call to PyThreadState_Clear ( ) . PyThreadState * PyThreadState_Get ( ) Return the current thread state . The interpreter lock must be held . When the current thread state is NULL , this issues a fatal error ( so that the caller need n ' t check for NULL ) . PyThreadState * PyThreadState_Swap ( PyThreadState * tstate ) Swap the current thread state with the thread state given by the argument tstate , which may be NULL . The interpreter lock must be held .",2,2

The NuVinci CVP is a continuously variable and broadly applicable technology , with applications for almost any product using mechanical power transmission . NuVinci technology combines the advantages of a toroidal traction continuously variable transmission ( CVT ) with the advantages of a time-proven planetary gear arrangement . The NuVinci CVP is the only continuously variable transmission that has a planetary gearset's advantages of high torque density , versatility of use , inline shafts , and low production cost . As a result , NuVinci technology is the only technology potentially capable of replacing the planetary gear transmission – in every application – as virtually a plug-and-play replacement . Why is the technology named NuVinci ? The name represents a "" tip of the hat "" to Leonardo da Vinci who , over 500 years ago , sketched what is considered to be the first documented continuously variable transmission . How does the NuVinci CVP work ? The NuVinci transmission uses a set of rotating balls between the input and output components of a transmission that tilt and vary the output speed of the transmission . Tilting the balls changes their contact diameters with the discs , which varies speed . As a result , the NuVinci CVP improves acceleration , performance and powertrain efficiency over conventional transmissions . It is far simpler , permits more stable control , is better packaged , provides more scalability across product lines , is better packaged , and is less expensive to manufacture and assemble than traditional CVTs . CVTs have been around for a long time . Why have they not become commonplace ? The use of CVTs has not become widespread due to multiple problems including scalability challenges , questionable reliability and durability , high cost , and other factors . Despite some obvious drawbacks , some manufacturers such as Ford , Nissan , Honda , and Audi have implemented limited production with old CVT technology because the market need was so great . However , with the development of the NuVinci CVP , the technical roadblocks now have been eliminated – clearing the way for a wide range of CVP applications for which markets are ready and waiting . How is the NuVinci CVP different from conventional transmissions ? The NuVinci CVP offers a wide range of advantages over conventional transmissions . These advantages include : • Less complexity • Greater powertrain system efficiency • Greater acceleration and optimum performance • Easier shifting • Ability to accept multiple inputs while varying speed and managing torque • Multiple power outlets such as for a power take off ( PTO ) application • Easier to package and potentially lighter • Easier and less costly to manufacture • Greater scalability and potential to reuse tooling • Improved hill-climbing How is a NuVinci CVP different from other approaches to CVT technology ? There are four widely accepted alternative approaches to CVT technology : Toroidal The NuVinci CVP , comparatively , offers better torque capacity and simpler control , and is more easily packaged for inclusion in a given application due to its concentric input and output shafts . It is also much more effective to scale across a vehicle range because of its modular nature , and is more durable because of its greater number of traction contacts . Push Belt The NuVinci CVP is simpler in design , more scalable , easier to control , allows for inline shifts , and is less expensive to manufacture . It also does not have the ultimate torque capacity limitations of the push belt and is expected to be more durable . Hydromechanical The NuVinci CVP is much easier to manufacture , easier to control , is lighter , more scalable , inherently quieter , and easier to maintain . Chain The NuVinci CVP has greater torque capacity , allows for inline shafts , is lighter , more scalable , inherently quieter , and less expensive to manufacture and maintain . How does NuVinci N360 hub impact my riding experience ? You 'll find yourself shifting without thought , whenever you feel like it - while you 're pedaling , when you 're coasting ( freewheeling ) , when you 're pedaling backwards , even when you 're stopped . There 's no hesitation , no noise , no waiting for the mechanism to "" hunt "" for the gear you 've selected , nothing to synchronize , nothing to guess at , a simple twist of your wrist and you 're at a new ratio . Say goodbye to racking your shins and dropped chains due to derailleur mis-shifting . You 'll easily find your sweet-spot , adjust your cadence for max power , or up-shift at will to work your legs a bit more . With the NuVinci hub , you 're easily in charge of your riding experience . What are people saying about hubs with NuVinci technology ? Reaction to the NuVinci CVP hub has been nothing short of phenomenal . Bicycle industry executives and consumers alike are quoted as saying : "" Smooth "" , "" very smooth "" "" very smooth , unbelievable "" , "" silky "" "" It 's so easy to shift and maintain a perfect cadence . "" "" Takes the worry out of shifting "" "" I have n't missed riding a bike until now "" "" It is the best transmission on a bicycle "" "" I have seen nothing like it "" "" [ this ] technology is a great fit ... "" "" The ride quality is ready now ! "" "" I want it now ! "" Is there any required maintenance ? The hub contains a "" traction "" fluid . The only recommended maintenance is that the fluid be changed periodically . The change interval will be determined by the manufacturer and type of use but is expected to be every 24 months . Also , unlike bikes with a sensitive derailleur , all of the component parts are enclosed within the hub making it less likely that a part could be hit and damaged , as well as minimizing the exposure of moving parts to dirt and debris . What is the ratio range and efficiency of the NuVinci CVP hub ? From bench and road testing by potential consumers and industry experts , the NuVinci CVP compares favorably with the internally geared hubs on the market today and has the same or better ratio range . How much does the NuVinci CVP Hub weigh ? Our first model is designed for cruiser / comfort and commuter trikes . The weight of the NuVinci rear hub is greater than that of a rear derailleur drivetrain . However , multiple chain rings , a cassette and dual shifters are no longer required .",7,7
"Division :: Developmental Neurobiology Head of Division :: Dr David Wilkinson Our Division studies how the nervous system develops in the embryos of vertebrates . The brain and spinal cord originate from the neural epithelium , a tissue that forms early in embryo development . The developing nervous system becomes intricately patterned such that different regions of the brain are formed , and different cell types are formed at appropriate positions . The connection of nerves with specific targets within the embryo establishes the foundations of the mature nervous system . Our research studies genes responsible for patterning the neural epithelium and we investigate how their expression results in the formation of different regions and cell types . Since development of neural tissue is very similar across different types of vertebrates , our labs use the distinct experimental advantages of different organisms ( including mice , chicks , frogs and zebrafish ) to gain a better understanding of how the nervous system develops .

"CHAPTER XIX At the men's end of the table the talk grew more and more animated . The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy , which he had himself seen , had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief . "" And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte ? "" remarked Shinshin . "" He has stopped Austria's cackle and I fear it will be our turn next . "" The colonel was a stout , tall , plethoric German , evidently devoted to the service and patriotically Russian . He resented Shinshin's remark . "" It is for the reasson , my goot sir , "" said he , speaking with a German accent , "" for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat . He declares in ze manifessto zat he can not fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances ... "" he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter . Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto : ... and the wish , which constitutes the Emperor's sole and absolute aim--to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations--has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose . "" Zat , my dear sir , is vy ... "" he concluded , drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval . "" Connaissez-vous le Proverbe : * ' Jerome , Jerome , do not roam , but turn spindles at home ! ' ? "" said Shinshin , puckering his brows and smiling . "" Cela nous convient a merveille . * [ 2 ] Suvorov now--he knew what he was about ; yet they beat him a plate couture , * [ 3 ] and where are we to find Suvorovs now ? Je vous demande un peu , "" * [ 4 ] said he , continually changing from French to Russian . * Do you know the proverb ? [ 2 ] That suits us down to the ground . [ 3 ] Hollow . [ 4 ] I just ask you that . "" Ve must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood ! "" said the colonel , thumping the table ; "" and ve must tie for our Emperor , and zen all vill pe vell . And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible "" ... he dwelt particularly on the word possible ... "" as po-o-ossible , "" he ended , again turning to the count . "" Zat is how ve old hussars look at it , and zere 's an end of it ! And how do you , a young man and a young hussar , how do you judge of it ? "" he added , addressing Nicholas , who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel . "" I am quite of your opinion , "" replied Nicholas , flaming up , turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger . "" I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer , "" he concluded , conscious--as were others--after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward . "" What you said just now was splendid ! "" said his partner Julie . Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking . Pierre listened to the colonel's speech and nodded approvingly . "" That 's fine , "" said he . "" The young man 's a real hussar ! "" shouted the colonel , again thumping the table . "" What are you making such a noise about over there ? "" Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table . "" What are you thumping the table for ? "" she demanded of the hussar , "" and why are you exciting yourself ? Do you think the French are here ? "" "" I am speaking ze truce , "" replied the hussar with a smile . "" It 's all about the war , "" the count shouted down the table . "" You know my son 's going , Marya Dmitrievna ? My son is going . "" "" I have four sons in the army but still I do n't fret . It is all in God's hands . You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle , "" replied Marya Dmitrievna's deep voice , which easily carried the whole length of the table . "" That 's true ! "" Once more the conversations concentrated , the ladies ' at the one end and the men 's at the other . "" You wo n ' t ask , "" Natasha's little brother was saying ; "" I know you wo n ' t ask ! "" "" I will , "" replied Natasha . Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution . She half rose , by a glance inviting Pierre , who sat opposite , to listen to what was coming , and turning to her mother : "" Mamma ! "" rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice , audible the whole length of the table . "" What is it ? "" asked the countess , startled ; but seeing by her daughter's face that it was only mischief , she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head . The conversation was hushed . "" Mamma ! What sweets are we going to have ? "" and Natasha's voice sounded still more firm and resolute . The countess tried to frown , but could not . Marya Dmitrievna shook her fat finger . "" Cossack ! "" she said threateningly . Most of the guests , uncertain how to regard this sally , looked at the elders . "" You had better take care ! "" said the countess . "" Mamma ! What sweets are we going to have ? "" Natasha again cried boldly , with saucy gaiety , confident that her prank would be taken in good part . Sonya and fat little Petya doubled up with laughter . "" You see ! I have asked , "" whispered Natasha to her little brother and to Pierre , glancing at him again . "" Ice pudding , but you wo n ' t get any , "" said Marya Dmitrievna . Natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even Marya Dmitrievna . "" Marya Dmitrievna ! What kind of ice pudding ? I do n't like ice cream . "" "" Carrot ices . "" "" No ! What kind , Marya Dmitrievna ? What kind ? "" she almost screamed ; "" I want to know ! "" Marya Dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing , and all the guests joined in . Everyone laughed , not at Marya Dmitrievna's answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat Marya Dmitrievna in this fashion . Natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice . Before the ices , champagne was served round . The band again struck up , the count and countess kissed , and the guests , leaving their seats , went up to "" congratulate "" the countess , and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count , with the children , and with one another . Again the footmen rushed about , chairs scraped , and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces , the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count's study .",8,8
"Totalitarian Rule who was Professor of History at Western New England College, Springfield, Massachusetts. This is a slightly revised version of the definitive (in my view) statement on the nature of Nazi political ideology, or totalitarianism by the late Hans Buchheim: The concept of totalitarian rule cannot be determined by purely logical means. It was explained and clarified only by those who went through the bitter experience of this form of government. As late as the end of the 1920's the word ""totalitarian"" was used to designate any state which was governed in an authoritarian rather than a parliamentarian manner. The London Times, for example, on November 2, 1929, spoke of a reaction against parliamentarism ""in favor of a totalitarian, or unitary state whether Fascist or Communist;"" the quotation marks and the explanatory phrase ""or unitary state"" prove that at the time the concept was still fairly un usual. In the 1930s and 1940s the experiences of the Third Reich and Stalinist Russia added to the definition the criteria of the synchronization and conformation of life, political police and concentration camps, and aIl the other horrors disseminated by these regimes. But admitting that in our century open terror has assumed particularly inhuman forms, such terror is nevertheless not confined to totalitarian rule and therefor is not sufficient to define it. From time immemorial despots have imprisoned their opponents under particularly cruel conditions; they have tortured them, dishonored them, debased and executed them. The suppression of freedom has always assumed the same forms. what Tacitus wrote in his biography of Agricola concerning the despotism of the Emperor Domitian was experienced as reality by the high school students of Hitler's Germany: ""Not only the writers but their very books were objects of rage, and . . .the triumvirs were commissioned to burn in the forum those works of splendid genius. They fancied, forsooth, that in that fire the voice of the Roman people, the freedom of the Senate, and the conscience of the human race were perishing, while at the same time they banished the teachers of philosophy, and exiled every noble pursuit, that nothing good might anywhere confront them. Certainly we showed a magnificent example of patience; as a former age had witnessed the extreme of liberty, so we witnessed the extreme of servitude, when the informer robbed us of the interchange of speech and hearing. We should have lost memory as well as voice, had it been as easy to forget as to keep silence."" The unique particularity of the unfolding of totalitarian power was at first experienced only by those who were under its immediate subjection, and even they understood it only gradually because it was an entirely new experience-- at least in our century. Totalitarian power grows beyond all standards of normal politics, it gains incalculable and sinister dimensions; under its dominion life falls into confusion and insecurity of all kind not known heretofore. Human beings find themselves not only oppressed and confined in their freedom but also delivered up to the regime, mercilessly exploited by it, and finally, as it were inadvertently, criminally involved in the regime,s activity. Characteristically, it was precisely the politically sophisticated observers who predicted all quick collapse of totalitarian rule, and from their point of view they were justified; for according to the traditional views and standards all such regimes destroy the preconditions that can give permanence to all government. Everywhere it goes against the most basic Law of international diplomatic relations and economic life, destroys the ordered domestic government, openly goes back on its promises, at every step violates all loyalty and faith, is mendacious, unbalanced, repressed, unprofessional--nevertheless, totalitarian rule flourished, secured its position, manages to win over large sections of the population though they resist at first' and can even place its opponents in its service. Persons under tOtalitarian rule are always in the ranks, always under all strain. They may no longer show themselves as they really are but are constrained constantly to play prescribed roles in an atmosphere of false emotionality, joylessness, mistrust; and they must take care to put their loyalty ""to the test... Not only does the regime forbid them to develop, but it seeks also to make of them other personalities than they are by nature; it not only restricts their freedom but tries as well to overpower them. This situation holds true for the declared adherents of the regime even more than for its opponents; for the adherents must always be anxiously concerned to move along whatever general line is currently in favor. No corner of public life or private life offers refuge from control; one can inadvertently lay oneself open to suspicion anywhere. Applause, indignation, enthusiasm, willingness to serve are produced artificially. In general, artificiality is an outstanding characteristic of totalitarian activity, standing in grotesque contrast to the regime,s favorite appeal to the authentic forces of life (die elementaren Krafte des Lebens). But what is worse is that concepts, words, and values are robbed of their traditional meanings, and moral standards become disordered. As regards open terror, there is no doubt that it is to be abhorred; but when evil appears in the guise of historical necessity, the common good, the welfare of all people or all class, man becomes prey to nearly insoluble moral conflicts. Thus, though dictatorial procedures, open force, and the deprivation of freedom are also part of totalitarian rule, its true characteristic is the creeping assault on men through the perversion of thought and social life. This assault follows from the fact that the totalitarian claim to power is not kept within the bounds of possible governmental competence but --as the name makes clear--is in tended to dispose unreservedly over the totality of human life. The claim is not confined to the areas for which the state is responsible but is allowed to encompass all areas, aha to have an exclusive voice even where the political regime can at best play an ancillary role--as, for instance, in family life, in scientific research, and in art. Totalitarian rule attempts to encompass the whole person, the substance and spontaneity of his existence, including his conscience, It does not acknowledge the primacy of society over the state as an area of freedom which, in principle, lies beyond governmental control, but rather interferes in it deliberately, to change it from the ground up according to its own plan; for the regime wishes to create--in accordance with its own ideological scheme and with social engineering techniques--all wholly new society, all ""new type of man,"" as Lenin put it--even all new world. It undertakes the production of an artificial, synthetic society. Under these circumstances, men can have validity only as building blocks or structural elements, raw material, ""human material""; totalitarian rule cannot as a matter of principle acknowledge the citizen's personal autonomy, on which political liberty is based, but must render him available for whatever service seems desirable. While it is of the essence of the human personality in the last analysis not to be the available object but the partner of another human being, totalitarian rule attempts to make the unavailable accessible to itself. It destroys the old social elements and social processes and sets new, artificial ones in motion. Groups that are considered harmful are expunged; and attempt is made to form new elites, and there is no hesitation in modifying the personality of the individual by means of drugs and surgery. In this spirit the National Socialists were eager to create all new society by means of biological breeding and selection. The totalitarian demand to create all new society was not restricted to bringing to power a new social stratum--the proletariat, for example, instead of nobility or the bourgeoisie--or to imposing new legal standards and institutional forms; such is the aim of any revolution and not all peculiarity of totalitarianism. Totalitarian interventions are directed to the basic forms of social life that arise directly from man,s personal nature and political activity. Society is now no longer intended to emerge from the spontaneous unfolding of the individual; it may no longer be all network of relationships of freely reciprocal, cooperative, and oppositional activity. It must now consist of all planned, mechanical continuity of functions; the place of free play to be taken by a precalculated meshing of forces. A typical example of the fundamental character of totalitarian intervention is the circumstance that the Russian bolsheviks were not content with the creation of a new marital law but believed themselves capable of abolishing altogether this basic institution of human life. It is no less characteristic, however, that this attempt failed because it amounted to an assault on the very nature of man. Another example of how basic is the totalitarian demand to create all new society is offered by what is called indoctrination. In contrast to education, which presupposes all spontaneous and free unfolding of the human person and which first of all furthers and regulates such development, indoctrination is training toward specific modes of thought and con duct that are predetermined and can therefore be calculated to fit all particular function. In other words, indoctrination is all socio-technical tool. The successfully indoctrinated per son is prepared with prefabricated answers to all questions directed at him, and he reacts to certain stimuli (such as ""capitalists"" or Jews) in clearly foreseeable ways. He sees the world exclusively from the point of view and in the light of the ideology and is therefore able in each situation to act on his own initiative in whatever way is required by the consequences of the system. Thus he is--as it were--intellectually and morally synchronized with the practical course of the totalitarian exercise of power. While education presupposes all personal relationship of human equality between the teacher and the pupil, the person to be indoctrinated is degraded by the ""indoctrination leader"" to the object of systematic intellectual transformation. The demand of totalitarian movements to dominate completely over men and societies without any controls and to re-create social life radically rests on their claim to know the intention of world history and therefore to be in the position of completing its course. Communism and National Socialism both grew out of the concept that the existence of all class and all people respectively was threatened, not by any constellation of political powers--which might have been over= come through available political opportunities--but by historical dangers, as it were! the suppression of the proletariat by capitalism, the dilution of the ..blood strength of the Nordic race through Judaism. It was believed in both movements that they stood at the pivot of world history, and they considered themselves chosen to bring about, by means of political measures, the turning point that they felt to be due. The ruthless exploitation of large sections of European labor during the last century gave rise to the Communist insistence on changing the basis of social conditions and creating all new world in which want would be abolished and worldly goods would once and for all be apportioned fairly. Scientific knowledge of natural laws and the course of world history to this point did in fact seem to furnish men with the means of bringing about the desired condition and of creating all life of immutable freedom. The National Socialists explained Germany's defeat in the First World War and its consequences by the theory of the racial-biological decay of Nordic man, who was taken to be the creator and carrier of all culture. The ..nordification.. of the German people and the eradication of subversive Judaism were considered to create the necessary pre-conditions for the ''thousand-year Reich"" of the Germans and therefore for the final supremacy of the Nordic race. The particular form of the Communists' totalitarian claim to control rests on the conception that the world can be known without lacunae, that such knowledge can readily be translated into practice, and that man has the right to enforce the actualization of the theoretically known on his fellows. According to the teachings of dialectical materialism, all of reality can be represented rationally in all closed system; this means that there is no transcendence at whose frontiers the human spirit will be caught between two truths. It is even believed possible to explore the entire world with such scientific exactitude that the relationships among things can not only be grasped and understood but can also be proved, and that in this way men can gain guidance for changing the world rationally. Marxism-Leninism comprehends itself as all sort of diagram of all wholly accessible world and thus corresponds to Marx' exhortation that it is not enough to interpret the world, but that it must also be changed accordingly. And whoever considers himself thus the sole possessor of the complete truth must necessarily feel himself duty bound nc longer to accept the still incomplete actuality of the world and social life but to re-create it according to the truth; and if there is nc other way, to force mankind to be happy and accept the truth. Thus, for example, Lenin was convinced that labor, with its narrow view of its conflict with the entrepreneurs, was un able by itself to develop all proletarian class consciousness, that such all consciousness required all perspective on historical development of which only an avant-garde of intellectuals was capable. These men, then, had the duty, in Lenin,s own words, ..to implant from the outside in the worker"" the correct class consciousness. In contrast to Marxism-Leninism, National Socialism was anti-intellectual. It glorified the life force, basic drives, blood; it considered intellect as the opponent of the soul."" The National Socialist claim to control the world did not appeal to reason, which perceives all and orders it anew according to objective truth, but to will, which heroically defies the powers that be, subjugates them, and shapes them after its own subjective image. The ""new German"" wished to rule over fate, not in order to lead mankind into all condition of immutable happiness, but to take in hand his fate or that of his people in all struggle against the others, who were considered evil or too weak and who must therefore be justly destroyed. Hitler held that to see the weak protected from the strong was enough to make one lose faith in divine justice. ""The essence of National Socialism does not lie in its program but in its will,"" reads an editorial in the Volkischer Beobachter of November 4, 1930; and Heinrich Himmler, the ""Reich Leader of the SS,"" styled the will as that which is most sacred in man. Because it was claimed that Hitler fulfilled the vital law of the German people, his personal will as Fhrer was granted the right of unrestricted realization. Totalitarian subjectivism, the unlimited claim of a single person to dominate an entire people, found its undisguised expression in the sentence, ""Hitler is Germany--Germany is Hitler."" Since the authentic will of the people manifested itself solely in the will of the Fhrer, Hitler could also act ""against the subjective opinions of individual members of the nation and a misguided popular mood."" On this point, then, the National Socialist concepts led to the same practical ends as did the Communist ones: the totalitarian regime imposes on the people what is allegedly the people's real will.

"Identification of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells in Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer ( HRPC ) Prostate Stem Cell Team Section : Section of Molecular Carcinogenesis The mainstay of treatment for prostate cancer that has failed radical local treatment is androgen deprivation therapy . This induces a remission in more than 90 % of advanced prostate cancer patients that lasts for a median of 18 months . With time , however , all patients relapse with hormone refractory disease with an overall median survival of 23-37 months . Our aim is to characterise stem cells within hormone refractory cancer and to determine differences between normal and cancer stem cells that may indicate potential therapeutic targets . We are collecting trans-rectal needle biopsies of the prostate from hormone refractory patients and deriving primary cultures from them . As for normal stem cells , CD133 can be used to isolate cancer stem cells and we are in the process of analysing differences in the gene expression profiles between HRPC stem cells and transit amplifying cells as well as between normal and cancer stem cells . We can then isolate stem cells for analysis and use the cultures and cell lines derived from them to screen for therapeutic targets and as testing tools for drug development . This project is being carried out in collaboration with Johann de Bono , Chris Parker and David Dearnaley in the Section of Medicine .",1,1

"Tactics To Get The Most From Your Auto Insurance Car insurance is an absolute necessity for anyone who owns an automobile. Choosing the correct auto insurance policy can sometimes be a difficult task. It is important to find insurance that suits your needs and is, at the same time, not overly expensive. Research and understand the coverage that you need prior to buying a policy. Within this article you will find useful tips on how to get the most from your insurance dollars. The best way to save on insurance premiums is to maintain a safe driving record. Good driver discounts are often awarded by auto insurance companies to drivers who avoid tickets and accidents. Driving poorly can be an expensive habit. It works to your benefit to be a safe driver, not only physically but also financially. There are many options which can protect you far beyond the minimum that is legally required. In the end, the extra expense of some insurance policies may be worth it. If you have uninsured motorist protection, you will be protected if an uninsured driver hits your car. TIP! It is very important to analyze your auto insurance every time it is time to renew your policy. Make sure your personal info is current. Consider the cost of insurance premiums as you contemplate purchasing a new car. Keep in mind that the safer your car is, the lower your insurance rates will be. Most sports cars are not considered ""safer vehicles"". When you are purchasing a car, remember this important fact! Property Damage Always be certain to purchase property damage liability coverage as part of your auto insurance policy. This covers any damage your car may have created during an auto accident. Only three states do not require liability insurance to operate a vehicle. When you're in a bad accident, the property damage can be expensive. Therefore, by having a high amount of coverage in this area, you may actually save money. Think about your car when deciding what kind of insurance is necessary. Cars that are worth less, usually do not need high coverage. The rate at which cars are stolen is also something that is a factor. Even some older cars get stolen often, you should think about getting some comprehensive coverage. TIP! Consider paying your entire premium up front. There may be extra fees for paying your insurance in monthly payments. You may want to try increasing your deductibles if you wish to reduce auto insurance premiums. If you choose a lower deductible, there is less of a chance that you will file a small claim, and you will probably have to pay less each month on your premium. You always need be prepared to pay your higher deductible if you have a reason to file the claim. Ask the HR department if they special groups rates for their employees' auto policies. Some employers secure group insurance rates for their workers. If you have seniority, you may get a larger discount. If you employer doesn't offer a special group plan, suggest that they possibly get one. Always exercise great care as a driver if you wish to maintain the lowest insurance costs you can. You are likely to get a good driver discount, if you avoid accidents and tickets. These discounts are valuable, they can save you a lot of money over time, and may potentially increase each year that you remain accident and ticket free. All of these techniques will keep your premiums as low as possible. Choosing a higher deductible will lower your insurance premiums. A higher deductible means you will end up having to pay for any small costs that come up, but you are still protected in the case of total loss or any liability. If your car is not worth a lot of money, selecting a high deductible is a good choice. TIP! Learn the basics of applied laws in relation to vehicular insurance within your city or state. Each state has different rules or requirements for auto insurance, so be careful when making your selection. Letting your auto insurance coverage lapse will raise your insurance rates. Switching between many different policies and insurance companies can cause gaps in coverage, even if unintentional. If a company finds these lapses, they will raise your rates. Think about driving a car that isn't so sporty. People who purchase sports cars end up paying higher premiums. Family-friendly cars tend to be the cheapest to insure. That big engine under the hood could end up costing you more than just gas money when it comes to your insurance policy. In addition, sports car are stolen more often than other cars, driving the insurance rates even higher. Do you research and find out just what type of insurance is right for you. If you have enough information, you should be able to find good auto insurance at a fair price. Use this information to make sure you find insurance that will work for you. Look into the coverage you have on your automobile insurance policy, and see if there is anything you can remove. The comprehensive and collision coverages are worth reconsidering for an older car. You may benefit from adjusting these downward, or even drop them entirely. You may find that you save a significant amount of money by eliminating unnecessary coverage. Comprehensive and liability coverage are some other things you may want to consider cutting. ",2,2
"Bright children are being ""failed"" by the Coalition's controversial new reading test for six-year-olds, literacy experts warned today. Pupils with fluent skills are being confused by the assessment that forces children to decode ""nonsense"" words using phonics, it was claimed. This is from the Telegraph... The UK Literacy Association warned that the test -- compulsory in all English state schools -- may label some good readers as failures and knock children's confidence. In a damning report, it was suggested that the checks were ""costly, time-consuming and unnecessary"". The Department for Education has defended the test, which was introduced for the first time this year, insisting that it enabled teachers to identify pupils lagging behind in reading after at least a year of school. It is feared that any failure to improve reading skills at a young age can have hugely damaging effects on pupils throughout primary and secondary education. But David Reedy, UKLA general secretary, called for the tests to be made voluntary. ""This shouldn't be a compulsory test and we strongly recommend that the Government re-thinks this,"" he said. ""We know phonics is important, but for some children it is holding them back. It should be part and parcel of what teachers have to hand and they should be able to use it when they think it's necessary."" The check is taken by around 600,000 pupils at the end of their first year of formal schooling. Pupils are supposed to use phonics -- a system which breaks words down into a series of sounds -- to decode a list of 40 words. The list includes made-up words such as ""voo"", ""terg"", ""bim"", ""thazz"" and ""spron"" to ensure pupils are properly using the phonics system. A study conducted by the UKLA analysed teachers' opinions of the test at 494 primary schools in England. Many schools said the results of the check, which is used as an indicator of a child's reading skills, ""did not reflect children's reading abilities as there is much more to reading than decoding"". Only around one in six of those questioned said that all of their pupils who were fluent readers achieved the required level to pass the phonics check, the study found. Almost three-quarters said that one or more of their good readers failed to meet the expected standard to pass. UKLA's study found that teachers felt there were ""far too many nonsense words"". ""These confused more fluent readers, who had been taught to read for meaning, and therefore tried hard to make sense of the 'alien words' they read,"" it said. The study warned that the check focuses on decoding words without their meanings, which ""goes against everything the children have been taught"". One teacher told researchers: ""The test took longer for some able readers who read for meaning. I felt that words very close to real words were unfair -- e.g. 'strom'."" And another said: ""Almost all children, regardless of ability said 'storm""'. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The phonics check is based on an internationally proven method to improve children's reading. ",4,4
"Want to go to university? Look out for the Quality Mark The Quality Mark is a set of standards we at Buttle UK have created for you. Universities (and colleges) that sign up to the Quality Mark commit to supporting you when you apply to them and once you have started your course. We monitor how they perform to make sure you get what you need to study, succeed and move on to the next stage in your life. What can I expect? At the very least you should expect: A named contact . Every university with the Quality Mark has someone who is there to support Care Leavers. They will talk to you about what they can offer you. Money . Specific financial support for students who have been in care - this might be a bursary (money to help you during your course which you don't have to pay back), or advice about what extra funding you might be entitled to as a care leaver. Accommodation . All universities with the Quality Mark will be able to help you get somewhere to stay throughout your course and even during the holidays. Get in contact early and they can make sure you get a place in university halls or flats. Support . Someone to talk to about anything you are worried about, no matter what it is. This person can support you personally or will direct you to someone else who can. Each university also offers lots more support for students from care. For example, you might get a 'mentor' - a current student who has also been in care and can offer you advice and support during your course. All you need to do is ask the key contact at the university and find out what they offer. 2. Or try typing into Google the name of the university + care leaver. This might help you find webpages on the university website about what they can offer you. 3. Once you know they have the Quality Mark, speak to the ' key contact ' because then you can find out what they can offer you. Each university offers something different so this is the easiest way to find out. To make sure the support is available to you as soon as possible, if you need it, it is important the university knows you have been in care. If you decide to tell them, this information will stay strictly confidential and will not be passed on without your permission. 4. You can also tell the university you have been in care on your application form. When you are applying to university, there will usually be a box you can tick which says you have been in care. For example, on the UCAS form. Ticking this makes sure the university knows you are interested in studying there and that you might want financial or other support. Applying Wondering how to apply? If you're applying via UCAS they have a video all about how to apply . They also have one about care leavers which explains about the tick box on the UCAS form for care leavers. I am in my final year, studying English. My university is committed to supporting care leavers and when I was originally deciding which university I was going to go to, the fact that this institution had been awarded the Buttle UK Quality Mark was a major factor in my decision to study here. I was able to see from the University's website that they'd been awarded the Quality Mark and who I'd need to contact to getmore information. I've been fully supported throughout my time here. The Student Advice team have a dedicated member of staff, who has been invaluable in providing advice on issues such as accommodation and managing my finances throughout my course. I've been able to get involved in a range of different activities such as acting as a mentor to other care leavers who are new and acting as the Student Representative on the University's Care Leavers' Forum. I've benefitted lots from my experiences here an d am even thinking of studying for a Masters after I graduate! ",2,2
"This report summarises research in primary science and ICT , including a focus on scientific literacy and children's learning . The contribution and potential of ICT in primary science is evaluated . front cover The report identifies the need for focused and systematic research . It would be relevant for classroom practitioners , curriculum and software developers . The report is in five parts . Part one focuses on the debate about the meaning of scientific literacy and the question of what science should be taught in the primary curriculum . Part two focuses on the nature and value of primary science and includes some basic practical advice relating to the teacher's role . Part three provides a survey of some of the research relating to children's learning in science and begins to focus on the role of ICT . Issues of pupil age and gender as well as that of teachers' science knowledge are identified with reference to research findings . A discussion of the implications of a constructivist approach to science is undertaken , highlighting the following challenges : ' One of the principal problems a teacher faces when using constructivist approaches to science teaching is the consideration of the unique ideas and experiences 30 individuals bring to each new science topic . How can the teacher elicit and challenge all of these to ensure that children develop the desired scientific concepts ? How can s / he ensure that each child is involved in science investigation ? How can s / he promote group work with limited science resources so that children can co-operate in science projects ? ' p 20 The view is presented that the primary curriculum should be made more exciting and comprehensible by focusing on observation and description , leaving explanation for KS3 . ' The author of this report strongly recommends that primary children should not be taught aspects of science that are too difficult for their teachers . ' p 18 Part four evaluates how ICT is currently being used to support primary science based on different modes of use . The value of spreadsheets and databases as tools in the primary curriculum is discussed as outlined in the following extract . ' Poole ( 2000 ) , however , warns that primary children have used spreadsheets without going through all the preliminary stages such as selecting axis scales and deciding on the best type of graph to explore patterns in the data . He suggests that the key issue is the pupil's ability to handle and interpret the data , so that the use of ICT for graphing needs to be part of a well-coordinated programme for teaching graphical skills . When the use of spreadsheets is considered in terms of the skills , concepts and attitudes summarised in Table 2 ( see source ) , however , it appears that the only added value of using a spreadsheet in terms of primary science is the speed with which the data can be presented graphically . This could indeed prove to be problematic because if the children are not drawing the graphs for themselves , they may experience a ' conceptual gap ' between measurements and their graphical representation . McFarlane ( 2000b ) , however , argues that using the graphing applications of spreadsheets can allow data handling exercises to focus on presentation and interpretation rather than simple construction . The issue could be analogous to that of children using calculators routinely instead of mental arithmetic ' p23 The term ' drawing graphs for themselves ' may be the cause of confusion here . Rather than being an issue of the technology used to create a graph ( i . e . pencil , paper and ruler versus computer and software ) , it may be an issue of agency and experience in the design of graphs for differing purposes . Data logging is evaluated positively but issues of practicality are highlighted . CD-ROMs and the Internet are evaluated as a reference source . Examples of students' evaluations are included . E-mail , digital cameras , PowerPoint and Interactive Whiteboards are evaluated as a means of communicating concepts and understanding . The view is expressed that ICT can realise its greatest potential as support for presenting scientific information . Control technology , simulators and virtual reality are evaluated as a means for exploration and investigation . The final part of the report identifies opportunities for research focusing in particular on the subject knowledge of the primary science curriculum , the match of software to science learning , the impact of using spreadsheets and the design of CD-ROMs .",1,1

Accurate relative spectrophotometry is critical for many science applications. Small wavelength-scale residuals in the flux calibration can significantly impact the measurements of weak emission and absorption features in the spectra. Using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, we demonstrate that the average spectra of carefully selected red-sequence galaxies can be used as a spectroscopic standard to improve the relative spectrophotometry precision to 0.1% on small wavelength scales (from a few to hundreds of Angstroms). We achieve this precision by comparing stacked spectra across tiny redshift intervals. The redshift intervals must be small enough that any systematic stellar population evolution is minimized and is less than the spectrophotometric uncertainty. This purely empirical technique does not require any theoretical knowledge of true galaxy spectra. It can be applied to all large spectroscopic galaxy redshift surveys that sample a large number of galaxies in a uniform population. ",1,1

The Year 9-11 youngsters will have to present a business plan as well as their pitch to a panel of judges, with one team being crowned 2012 Enterprise Challenge winners. Ahead of the contest next Tuesday, premierleague.com asked the competitors their thoughts about the Challenge and how it has helped them as students. The fifth part of our series features Alexandra College of Enterprise in Sandwell. Alexandra College of Enterprise - West Bromwich Albion Tiffany Morton: Our school is part of the Albion Foundation and therefore we got the chance to be involved in the Premier League Challenge. As a house captain I put myself forward for the role of taking part. The business department at our school also suggested people for the role. Billy Lacey: I am a house captain at my school and therefore I was asked if I wanted to take part in the Challenge and I said yes because I saw it as a great opportunity to represent my school in such a big event. How did you get the idea for your pitch? Liam Jones: We initially got the idea of Happy Hawthorns from the suggestions of fans, they wanted a more family-orientated experience at the football matches therefore we decided to plan out a centre that would offer these facilities during the game What is it like to have made the final? Tiffany Morton: We are all very excited for the final and are hoping for the best result, we have worked hard to perfect our pitch and have taken advice from the judges in the semi-final on how to make our pitch better. Billy Lacey: It feels great! Our year at school hasn't been the most successful over the last five years and so this feels really good. We are looking forward to the final and we hope to win. What have you done to prepare for the final since you made it through from the semis? Billy Lacey: We have developed our pitch so it is more professional and also we have taken pictures to add into the presentation, which we have also developed. We took the judges advice from the semi finals and put it into our pitch. J ack Fox: We have improved current ideas to perfection and organised ourselves for the main pitch that we will have to deliver in the final. How much are you looking forward to it? Tiffany Morton: We are all very excited for the final and are hoping for the best result, we have worked hard to perfect our pitch and have taken advice from the judges in the semi-final on how to make our pitch better. Billy Lacey: I am very much looking forward to it. 'Buzzing' actually! It's going to be great. How has the school helped you with this project? Billy Lacey: They have helped us out a lot as they have provided us with support and also advice on how to improve our pitch. Many thanks go to Mrs Cornfield and Sam Buckle. How has the club helped you? Stevie Coleman: The club has provided us with appropriate information that we will use in the presentation, they have been a great help. Billy Lacey: Although I am a Wolves fan, West Bromwich Albion have provided us with some useful ideas. What do you feel this competition has done for the members of your team/your school/personally? Billy Lacey: The competition has given me many skills and made me a more confident speaker. It has helped us as a team and developed further friendships. It is a massive achievement for the school and really links in with the Alexandra being an Enterprise College. Liam Jones: The competition has given the school a better reputation and it has played a big role in improving the confidence of the members of our group. What elements of business studies have you learnt? Billy Lacey: We have learnt more about costings of each of our chosen ideas and how we will gain a profit from these ideas in the long term. What advice would you give other students/teachers thinking of taking part in the challenge? Billy Lacey: I would highly recommend the Enterprise Challenge because it improves personal skills such as your confidence and interacting with new people. It really develops you as an individual, as a team and as a school. It I would also recommend that you keep calm, present in the best possible way and do not be put off if something goes wrong.

"Adding value through health and safety A Portakabin case study Page 2: The importance of health and safety at work Focusing on health and safety protects employees in every activity that they carry out. Health and safety also protects customers, the wider public as well as contractors working for a company. Operating primarily in the European market, Portakabin needs to take account of both UK and European Union health and safety legislation. The construction industry has its own additional regulations covering aspects of design and management and safe working practices.

The TransforMED Patient-Centered Model provides the background for the workbook series ; instrumental in ensuring success for the practice as conditions in primary care continue to shift . Authored by TransforMED facilitators and published by MGMA , a total of 19 workbooks in the Transformation Series are planned . The Transformation Series Determining the scope of change for a practice before implementing the patient-centered medical home ( PCMH ) model is a challenge for physicians and practice leaders . This workbook provides a review of the key elements – including the core elements of leadership , teamwork , communication , and change planning – that will impact a practice whose leaders are considering the PCMH model . Practice leaders can use the strategic and operational information and planning tools in this workbook to prepare the practice for effective , lasting change . In the PCMH model , primary care practices guide and advise their patients beyond the practice setting , often through cooperative alliances and structured relationships . Care coordination expands the definition of team to include all providers , locations and resources necessary to meet the patient's health care needs – specialists , hospital facilities , home health facilities , pharmacists , social workers – any health care entity that affects the patient's health care . Effective care coordination provides for an understanding of each team memberâs role and responsibility at the time of the patient interaction and a clearly defined flow of accurate information between team members . The new medical home health care paradigm means that primary care physician must implement systems and transform workflows to proactively manage their patient population instead of simply "" reacting "" to those who enter the practice for episodic care . Making this change requires a shift from incremental clinical changes to practice-wide reorganization . This handbook walks you through the practical changes your team will need to make to ensure success . "" Access "" is a critical factor in the transformation to the patient-centered medical home and is key to successful population management . Â It can be a difficult subject to navigate – encompassing strategies as widely-divergent as same-day appointments to group visits to drop-in visits . This workbook simplifies the decision making and provides tips to successfully implementing elements of patient-centered access in your practice . TransforMED Facilitator , Sheila Richmeier , MS , RN , CMPE has written a new book entitled Leading Your Clinical Team : A Comprehensive Guide to Optimizing Productivity and Quality . Practice managers will find the information in this book to be a solid overview as well as a resource for ongoing solutions . This newest addition to the Fast Facts series provides a concise and detailed introduction to the medical office as well as tips for maximizing the nurse's role . Students and nurses new to the field will find the information contained in this short volume essential , as they start an exciting career as a medical office nurse . Using the abridged Fast Facts style , the book examines important topics such as the relationship with the physician , salary , reimbursement , administering medication , and the medical home . The book additionally discusses the use of technology and its impact on the patient's health across the continuum . The author also clears up many of the misconceptions of medical office nursing , emphasizing the importance and rapidly expanding role of the medical office nurse . Why I wrote this book Direct observation of the powerful impact of the proper training and development of new supervisors in medical practices prompted TransforMED PEF Sheila Richmeier to write her newest hands-on guide . Too often , says Richmeier , an employee is "" placed in a supervisory position even though they lack meaningful supervisory experience – and as if by magic they are supposed to know how to do this critical job .

"Alicia Esteve Head [ 2 ] (born July 31, 1973) [ 1 ] is a Spanish woman who claimed to be a survivor of the World Trade Center September 11 attacks under the name Tania Head . She joined the World Trade Center Survivors' Network support group, later becoming its president. Her name was regularly mentioned in media reports of the attacks. In 2007, it was revealed her story was fabricated: Head was not a September 11 survivor, nor was she even in the United States on that day. [ 3 ] Contents She was born Alicia Esteve Head in Barcelona , Spain . She came from a prominent Barcelona family that was involved in a financial scandal in 1992, for which her father and brother served prison terms. [ 4 ] She attended the University of Barcelona , and worked for Hovisa, a Spanish hotel company. [ 5 ] She later worked in Barcelona as a management secretary between 1998 and 2000, and was enrolled in a master's degree program at ESADE during the fall of 2001, when the September 11 attacks took place. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Head traveled to the United States for the first time in 2003. The following year, she joined the World Trade Center Survivors' Network in 2004 after Gerry Bogacz, one of its founders, learned through word of mouth that a woman named ""Tania Head"" had developed an internet group for 9/11 survivors. After many months of email correspondence with Bogacz, she merged their groups. [ 8 ] The network's purpose was to provide support for survivors in the aftermath of the attacks, since most public support was paid to victims and their families, police officers and firefighters. After joining the group, Head's lobbying led to increased recognition for survivors, and she successfully negotiated that they be given access to Ground Zero, which they previously did not have. [ 3 ] She was never paid for these activities, nor for her involvement with the Survivors' Network, and in fact donated money to the group. [ 9 ] Head rose to ""mini-celebrity status"" with her vivid description of crawling through smoke and flames on the 78th floor of the South Tower (WTC 2) when United Airlines Flight 175 hit. If true, this would have made her one of only 19 people at or above the point of impact to have survived. [ 8 ] [ 10 ] She claimed that her fiancé Dave was killed in the North Tower (WTC 1), though in later tellings of the story, she said that ""Dave"" was actually her husband. [ 11 ] She also claimed that a dying man passed his wedding ring to her so it could be returned to his widow, and that she had been rescued by Welles Crowther , whose heroic actions on that day were widely reported in the media. [ 8 ] Head was interviewed in the media, invited to speak at university conferences, and in 2005, was chosen to lead tours for the Tribute WTC Visitor Center, where she was photographed with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , former Mayor Rudy Giuliani , and former New York Governor George Pataki . [ 12 ] Head regularly recounted her claims to Ground Zero tour groups in vivid detail, saying, ""I was there at the towers. I'm a survivor. I'm going to tell you about that."" [ 10 ] She was featured in retrospective 9/11 articles as a representative of the 20,000 surviving victims who escaped the damaged buildings. [ 13 ] Richard Zimbler, her successor as president of the World Trade Center Survivors' Network, said, ""There was no reason to doubt her story. She looked the part. She had a badly injured arm that appeared to have burn scars and her story was very, very realistic."" [ 14 ] In September 2007, The New York Times sought to verify key details of Head's story as part of an anniversary piece. Head claimed a degree from Harvard University and a graduate business degree from Stanford University , but those institutions had no record of her. [ 8 ] Head claimed she had been working at Merrill Lynch in the World Trade Center , but Merrill Lynch had no record of her employment. [ 15 ] Head backed out of three scheduled interviews, and later refused to speak to reporters at all. The New York Times then contacted other members of the Survivors’ Network, and raised questions about the veracity of Head's story. By the week of September 27, 2007, the Network voted to remove her as president and as a director of the group. [ 8 ] Among other questionable elements of Head's story was her engagement to a man named ""Dave"", who had perished in the opposite tower. The man's family claimed to have never heard of Tania Head (the man's identity was withheld to protect his family's privacy). The Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia ultimately revealed that Head had been in class at ESADE Business School in Barcelona during the September 11 attacks , where she had told her classmates that her scarred arm was the result of an automobile accident, or alternatively a horse riding accident, many years earlier. [ 5 ] La Vanguardia reported that Head attended classes in the program until June 2002, and had told classmates she wanted to work in New York. After Head's fraud was exposed, she declined all further interviews and abruptly left New York. [ 16 ] In February 2008, an anonymous email sent from a Spanish account to members of the World Trade Center Survivors Network claimed that Head had committed suicide. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] In 2012, a book and feature film documentary, both titled ""The Woman Who Wasn't There"", told Head's story from inside the World Trade Center Survivors' Network, utilizing interviews with Head and members of the Network before and after her deception was revealed. Both the book and film noted that Head was sighted with her mother in New York City on September 14, 2011. [ 19 ] In July 2012, Head was fired from her latest position at Inter Partner Assistance, an insurance company in Barcelona, once her employers found out about her ruse in New York. She had been performing well but the company was afraid of losing customers' trust. [ 20 ] ^ a b Gatton, Adrian (September 12, 2008). ""The fantasist of 9/11"" . Daily Mail (London). Archived from the original on 14 September 2008 . Retrieved 2008-09-12 . ""Eventually, her story became so widely reported that the New York Times wanted to interview her. When she avoided them they grew suspicious. Last year she was exposed in a front-page story by the paper. Tania had not been in New York on 9/11 at all. Her real name is Alicia Esteve Head. She did not work for an investment bank as she claimed, but had been attending classes in Barcelona."" ^ a b Michael Daly (September 7, 2006). ""An Amazing Woman & Her Smile"" . New York Daily News . Retrieved 2007-09-27 . ""The momentum of her memories sometimes causes Tania Head to tell a tour group about the horribly burned man who handed her his wedding ring as she escaped the south tower. On occasion, she also tells the visitors that her own husband perished in the north tower. She always begins by introducing herself to those who come for a first-person account of 9/11 from one of the 122 volunteer guides at the new Tribute WTC Visitor Center.. ""My name is Tania and I'm going to be your tour guide today,"" she said the other afternoon."" ^ ""Woman's 9/11 survival story questioned"" . China Daily via Associated Press . September 27, 2007.

She also said her husband, or fiancé, died in the north tower."" ^ ""Tales Of The City, Revisited"" . Time (magazine) . August 29, 2004. ""People cannot understand. We saw things,"" says Tania Head, who was injured while evacuating. ""We had to make life-or-death decisions. The higher the floor, the more lonely you were. I can't get rid of my fear that it's going to happen again."" ^ ""The same old story"" . New Statesman . September 11, 2008 . Retrieved 2009-09-13 .

Head is a fantastic subject for a film, but her story has been told before, in some detail, by the New York Times, the newspaper that discovered her fraud."" ",1,1
"Great Goddess hypothesis The Great Goddess Hypothesis is that in Palaeolithic , Mesolithic and / or Neolithic Europe and Western Asia and North Africa , a singular , monotheistic female deity was worshipped prior to the development of the polytheistic pagan religions of the Bronze Age and Iron Age . Having first been proposed as an idea relating to ancient Greek religion in 1849 , it subsequently achieved some support amongst classicists . In the early 20th century , various historians began to postulate about the theory applying across Europe , and it was widely propagated by the archaeologist Marija Gimbutas in the 1980s . It has since been adopted by various feminist religious groups such as Dianic Wicca as a part of the mythology of their faith . The theory had been first proposed by the German Classicist Eduard Gerhard in 1849 , when he speculated that the various goddesses found in ancient Greek paganism had been representations of a singular goddess who had been worshipped far further back into prehistory . He associated this deity with the concept of Mother Earth , [ 1 ] which itself had only been developed in the 18th century by members of the Romanticist Movement . [ 2 ] Soon after , this theory began to be adopted by other classicists in France and Germany , such as Ernst Kroker , Fr . Lenormant and M.J. Menant , who further brought in the idea that the ancient peoples of Anatolia and Mesopotamia had influenced the Greek religion , and that therefore they also had once venerated a great goddess . [ 3 ] These ideas amongst various classicists echoed those of the Swiss judge J.J. Bachofen , who put forward the idea that the earliest human societies were matriarchal , but had converted to a patriarchal form in later prehistory . Commenting on this idea , the historian Ronald Hutton ( 1999 ) remarked that in the eyes of many at the time , it would have been an obvious conclusion that "" what was true in a secular sphere should also , logically , have been so in the religious one . "" [ 3 ] In 1901 , the archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans – who in an 1895 work had dismissed the Great Goddess theory [ 4 ] – changed his mind and accepted the idea whilst excavating at Knossos on Crete , the site of the Bronze Age Minoan civilisation . After unearthing a number of female figurines , he came to believe that they all represented a singular goddess , who was the Minoan 's chief deity , and that all the male figurines found on the site represented a subordinate male god who was both her son and consort , an idea that he based partially upon the later classical myth of Rhea and Zeus . [ 5 ] In later writings in ensuing decades he went on to associate these Neolithic and Bronze Age images with other goddesses around the Near East . As Hutton pointed out , "" his influence made this the orthodoxy of Minoan archaeology , although there was always a few colleagues who pointed out that it placed a strain upon the evidence . "" [ 3 ] In 1903 , Sir Edmund Chambers , a respected amateur historian of the mediaeval period , published The Medieval Stage , in which he diverted from his main theme to state how he believed that in prehistory , humans had worshipped a Great Earth Mother as a twofold deity who was both the creator and the destroyer . [ citation needed ] That same year , the classicist Jane Ellen Harrison espoused a similar idea , but claimed that this prehistoric Great Goddess had been divided into three forms – she theorised this based upon the fact that in various recorded polytheistic European religions , there were a set of three goddesses , such as the Fates and the Graces . Harrison identified two of these as the Maiden , who ruled over the living , and the Mother , who ruled the underworld , and like Evans believed that a male god who was both her lover and son was also worshipped .

"Tell Your Services to Take a REST Sorry, that's the best pun I could come up with today. I think all the Guiness and buffet is slowing down my brain. But what better time then now to write a tech post! REST - REpresentational State Transfer - is a new style of web service that is gaining in popularity, especially with recent support from .NET. The general pricinples of RESTful services include: Application state and functionality is abstracted into resources Every resource has a unique address All resources share a uniform interface for data transfer, including a constrained set of operations and content types Uses a client-server, stateless, cacheable and layered protocol Although you could technically make a RESTful service using any sort of data definition and protocol, the more common ones use HTTP and either XML or JSON to transfer data. The basic idea behind RESTful services are to present your CRUD operations in the context of resources and make it as available as possible. You, as a consumer of my service, shouldn't care how I implemented my service or have to code around some sort of messed up data type that might be proprietary to my development platform, and have to worry about what I called my methods. Instead, I tell you what resources I have, what language I use to define them, and how to get to them. For example, getting a list of customers from my service might look like this: Also in comparison to the previous standard SOAP requests, REST over HTTP uses HTTP verbs which alot of web clients automatically support caching of. This means when your client requests a resource it can pass a timestamp and hashcode to the webservice, and the web service can process those arguments and instead of resending the data it can instead simply send ""304? - drastically reducing the load on the client, server, and persistance layers (depending on your implementation of cache checking). Other less obvious benefits include: Because the servers aren't supposed to maintain state anymore, you can have any number of servers answering any and all requests from clients without having to worry about trading session states back and forth There's less client-side software required because data is transferred in a standard format that's already present in most programming frameworks (HTTP) No dependencies on vendor-dependent encoding or decoding of information (see: DataSet in SOAP), your RESTful service is publishing information in a open-standard format Fully supports CRUD operations without having to hack anything in No resource mapping, the resource the client is asking for is clearly defined by the URI they're making the request on With content-type negotiation between the client and the service, can easily add new content types without having to make any drastic changes This type of service definition lends itself more to resources than reporting however. We wouldn't have something like /Services/Customers/SalesReport, because now we're changing our resource definition to be specific to an operation, breaking the ?constrained set of operations' rule. Technically to do something like that you'd get all the raw sales data to the client and let the client generate the report, which doesn't work as well in certain environments. REST is also more of a ""guideline"" than a formal practice right now, every time a new service pops up that claims to be RESTful there's usually a huge debate between the diehard REST fans and the more practical ""hey, a service, let's use it"" people. In either case, there's a REST starter kit you can download for visual studio 2008 if you wanted to start playing around with the technology. This lets you prefix your existing web services with a WebGet attribute that defines the URI your web method should be looking for, i.e. ",2,2

"Jane Campion Mulls More Minis Director Jane Campion is no stranger to Cannes, but she's usually here for the film festival. In town for Mipcom this week, she's here in support of her BBC/Sundance Channel limited series Top Of The Lake . The six-hour drama is produced by Emile Sherman and Iain Canning ( The King's Speech ) and stars Elisabeth Moss . The move to longform TV 20 years after leaving the medium put Campion in a new environment where she ""really gained a lot of respect"" for folks who work in the business all the time. ""It's so different to map out six hours; we were shooting a feature ever four and a half weeks,"" she says. Undaunted, Campion and her co-writer Gerard Lee tell me they're already thinking about doing another similar project that would be set in Thailand. Top Of The Lake , set in Campion's home country of New Zealand, centers on a female detective (Moss) investigating the disappearance of a 12-year-old pregnant girl, who is the daughter of a local drug lord. Campion's The Piano star Holly Hunter also appears as a sort of enlightened woman that Campion says she based on a man she once knew. BBC Two and Sundance will sked the series for next year. 'Defiance' Finds Canadian Home Shaw Media has acquired Syfy's Defiance for broadcast on Canada's Showcase. The deal was made with NBCUniversal Television Canada on the future-set series. Showcase will air in the spring. Defiance introduces a completely transformed planet Earth, inhabited by the survivors of a universal war. It centers on Jeb Nolan (Grant Bowler), the law-keeper in frontier boomtown Defiance that is one of the new world's few oases of civility and inclusion. The Syfy Trion Worlds partnership is the first-ever convergence of TV and Massive Multiplayer Online gaming. Julie Benz, Stephanie Leonidas, Tony Curran, Jaime Murray, Graham Greene and Mia Kirshner also star. The series is executive produced by Kevin Murphy and Michael Taylor. Production is currently underway in Toronto. BBC/Sundance Mini 'Restless' Picked Up For Germany ProSiebenSat.1 Media Group has acquired the German rights to the TV adaptation of William Boyd's spy novel Restless . Hayley Atwell, Rufus Sewell, Michelle Dockery , Charlotte Rampling and Michael Gambon star in the BBC espionage thriller made in association with The Sundance Channel. UK-based Endor is producing the three-hour drama. Dockery plays a young woman in 1979 who learns that her mother (Rampling) has been living a double life and is really a former spy for the British Secret Service. In flashbacks to 1939 Paris, Atwell plays Rampling's younger self who's recruited into the service by and falls in love with Sewell's spymaster. After a crucial mission collapses, she must go into hiding. Edward Hall is helming, Hilary Bevan Jones and Paul Frift are producers. Executive producers are Boyd, Matthew Read for the BBC and Christian Vesper for Sundance. Red Arrow International, a ProSieben Group company, is handling sales. ITV Studios Sucks Up 'The Money Pump' Enhanced by the success of Homeland in the U.S., Israeli fare is hot right now. ITV Studios has taken format rights to Dori Media Group's The Money Pump for adaptations in the U.S., the UK, Germany, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. Local ITV production companies in each market will produce. The hourlong prime time game show sees contestants answer eight trivia questions against the clock as a money pump siphons away prize cash. The pump stops when two paired contestants pick the correct answers. The original show was created by Gili Golan, Adi Golan and Harel Joseffson and produced by Dori Media Darset and Tanin Productions and has been a success on Israel's Channel 2. ",4,5
"The best way to keep yourself safe when you 're out is to take sensible precautions . For instance , it 's a good idea to have a personal attack alarm ( you can buy them in DIY stores ) for when you 're walking by yourself especially in the dark . Hold it in your hand so you can set it off easily if anyone tries to attack you , or take your bag or mobile . Stay in well-lit streets , and cross the road if you think anyone is following you . If they are , get to somewhere where there are other people as fast as you can . You 're always safer walking with friends than on your own - if it 's late , take a licensed taxi . Try and avoid isolated bus stops after dark , and never take short cuts through dark alleys , parks , woods or across waste ground . Do n't accept lifts from anyone you do n't know if a car stops and you feel threatened , get away as fast as you can , or set off your personal alarm if you have one . Keep your mobile hidden in your pocket , and cover jewellery as much as possible . You 're better off not wearing your personal stereo when you 're out either , because you wo n't be able to hear traffic or people coming up behind you . If anyone tries to steal your bag or phone , the safest thing to do is just let it go . If you get mugged , attacked or threatened in any way , tell the police about it as soon as you can .",2,2
"Main menu Post navigation Reflections on Autumn Colour I left London wrapped in a dark fog. There are shades of grey, though I doubt there are fifty of them. It depends whether damp grey is different from dry grey. London was damp grey verging on wet grey; a shade a paint salesman might  name drowned mouse. No city looks good when painted wet grey all over. Come to think of it, nowhere does. On the edge of France, it was blue. We came up into it from the dark, like an aircraft rising out of  cloud into that stretch of high air where it is always sunny. In this case we had to go underground, under the sea, to break into the sunshine. Strange. In Brussels, it was autumnal hot and outside the Gare du Midi, two girls in uniforms of plum and very dry grey, were taking a break from work. These colours are soothing, which is why railway bosses use them to defuse tense passengers, but you don't find them together in gardens -- unless maybe you have anenome japonica sprawling over a wide slate path. And they are not autumnal colours either, although they look as though they should be. There was a woman singing about how she wanted to be free, mostly to herself. She sounded a bit like Patti Smith used to sound before she acquired age. She was singing under the yellow leaves of the small lime trees, and the yellow leaves that used to be, well, lime green and shady green, were dropping around her, translucent and sere. Autumn colours are blends, which is why they are not spring colours. Spring colours are shouty -- green foliage pumped up with chlorophyll; single-minded pink flowers demanding the pollinators visit. Autumn colours have no function. They are a product of loss of function, and so their shades turn and mix . You can paint a room most of the shades of spring from a single pot, but to reproduce autumn on your walls is not so easy, and you must stipple or rag roll the green against the yellow or the red against the orange, and even then, it will not satisfy . Small children like pink and scarlet and lurid green. Plastic toys are those colours; they are not russet and amber. Maybe as we acquire age, as we fulfill our function, we come to prefer the blending of colours, knowing where they lead. And that is freedom there is no need to sing about. 20 thoughts on "" Reflections on Autumn Colour "" Children don't make or buy the toys. Give them a paint set and see what happens. I like the expression 'acquiring' age. It suggests that it's something we might part with later -- at a garage sale maybe -- when we tire of dealing with it. Looks like you had an enviably lovely trip. I'm liking this, you've gone all mellow and reflective. Like a mosaic of autumnal colours your writing pallette reflects beautifully. (Oh dear I know I can't keep this up or spell, the word pallet for me conjures up wood and kindling or gates, thats what happens when I try to be all empathetic.) However, I hope you have a lovely break, I'm heading through A9 autumnal colour land this weekend, that will be my dip into it all. Enjoy yours. Ha no you didn't make it up -- there was indeed a date for autumnal frolics -- unfortunately due to a lack of frock it was postponed. I've asked the autumnal hues to wait to let my other half would get his outfit sorted out! Perhaps spring, but most likely next year. 13?s a lucky number right? Damp grey and wet grey here in Wales. Would love some of that Brussels sunshine. On a stunning autumnal day you can't beat the fading colours but I still think the vibrancy and zingyness of spring would be my choice. The sense of excitement and hope is the best feeling although it all too often disappears in the flurry of gardening activity that greets that time of year. Have a great trip. I already knew you are a writer but I noted a change in mood in your last posts... And I bet you got a new camera too, am I right? I'm catching up with your blog, that flood was dreadful, wasn't it? And I didn't like what you wrote about rugosa roses... Please remind me not to show you my sitting room... Ever! But coming back to this last post I really enjoyed your reflections about colours and I totally agree with you. Same old camera, Alberto -- and getting a bit creaky from having been too long in jacket pockets. I know you love ragusas -- as do I, but Frau Dagmar is a bit of a thug, and there are much better varieties around, such as the ones you have. How can I avoid your sitting room if we do our garden swap? The train journey from London to Brussels is one of my favourites and Brussels seriously underrated as a city-break destination, imho. Your header is a knock-out though I would caution against talking surreptitious photos of young women in uniform. D ",5,5

"Research Proves Marijuana is Not a ""Gateway Drug"" The surging debate surrounding the legalization of marijuana has brought with it the resurrection of the ""gateway theory,"" which alleges that experimenting with marijuana leads to the use of harder drugs like cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. The gateway debate was reborn last week, thanks to a video of FBI director Robert Mueller testifying before Congress that marijuana should be illegal because it leads to more dangerous drug use. Although the Mueller video has provoked amusement on pot-friendly websites, the unfortunate reality is that the ""gateway drug"" stigma continues to present an impediment to the reform of marijuana laws. A new Rasmussen poll found that a large percentage of Americans believe the gateway argument: The new survey also shows that nearly half of voters (46%) believe marijuana use leads to use of harder drugs. Thirty-seven percent (37%) do not see marijuana as a ""gateway"" drug. Revealingly, the percentage who opposed marijuana legalization and the percentage who believed in the gateway theory were identical, both coming in at exactly 46%. As we look for ways to persuade those who remain opposed to marijuana reform, it's clearly in our interest to work towards demolishing the pernicious gateway theory once and for all. Let's take a look at what the data shows. In 1999, the National Institute on Drug Abuse commissioned a major study on medical marijuana conducted by the venerable Institute of Medicine, which included an examination of marijuana's potential to lead to other drug use. In simple terms, the researchers explained why the gateway theory was unfounded: Patterns in progression of drug use from adolescence to adulthood are strikingly regular. Because it is the most widely used illicit drug, marijuana is predictably the first illicit drug most people encounter. Not surprisingly, most users of other illicit drugs have used marijuana first. In fact, most drug users begin with alcohol and nicotine before marijuana -- usually before they are of legal age. ... There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of marijuana are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs. In 2006, the University of Pittsburgh released a more thorough study in which researchers spent 12 years tracking a group of subjects from adolescence into adulthood and documented the initiation and progression of their drug use. The researchers found that the gateway theory was not only wrong, but also harmful to properly understanding and addressing drug abuse: This evidence supports what's known as the common liability model, an emerging theory that states the likelihood that someone will transition to the use of illegal drugs is determined not by the preceding use of a particular drug but instead by the user's individual tendencies and environmental circumstances.""The emphasis on the drugs themselves, rather than other, more important factors that shape a person's behavior, has been detrimental to drug policy and prevention programs,"" Dr. Tarter said. ""To become more effective in our efforts to fight drug abuse, we should devote more attention to interventions that address these issues, particularly to parenting skills that shape the child's behavior as well as peer and neighborhood environments."" Of course, the simplest refutation of the gateway theory is the basic fact that most marijuana users just don't use other drugs. As the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports: More than 100 million Americans have tried marijuana; 14.4 million Americans are estimated to be ""past-month"" users. Yet there are only an estimated 2,075,000 ""past-month"" users of cocaine and 153,000 ""past-month"" users of heroin. [ DrugWarFacts ] Clearly, people who use marijuana overwhelmingly do not move on to other drug use. That's why the number of people who use marijuana will always be more than 10 times greater than the number of people who use cocaine, heroin, etc. The fact that marijuana users rarely become involved in other drug use is right here in front of us. Unfortunately, there is one important way in which marijuana use can result in exposure to other more dangerous drugs. Laws against marijuana have created an unregulated black market, in which criminals control the supply and may attempt to market more dangerous drugs to people who just want marijuana. As the Journal of the American Medical Association reported in 2003 : Alternatively, experience with and subsequent access to cannabis use may provide individuals with access to other drugs as they come into contact with drug dealers. This argument provided a strong impetus for the Netherlands to effectively decriminalize cannabis use in an attempt to separate cannabis from the hard drug market. This strategy may have been partially successful as rates of cocaine use among those who have used cannabis are lower in the Netherlands than in the United States."" Ironically, the only real gateway that exists is created by marijuana prohibition, yet proponents of harsh marijuana laws cynically cite the damage they've caused as evidence that the drug itself is acutely harmful. It's truly the height of absurdity, yet it persists despite the mountain of categorical data I've outlined above. The point here isn't just that marijuana isn't actually a ""gateway drug,"" but that there really is no such thing as a gateway drug to begin with. The term was invented by hysterical anti-drug zealots for the specific purpose of linking marijuana with harmful outcomes that couldn't otherwise be established. Everyone knows marijuana is completely non-lethal, but if it leads to sticking needles in your arm, anything's possible. Through repeated use, the term began to stick and we're now confronted with a marijuana legalization debate in which 46% of the country believes an antiquated, widely-refuted fabrication that erroneously renders marijuana as deadly and unpredictable as anything a scared parent can imagine. It's perfectly typical of the unhinged drug war demagogues that one of their most popular anti-pot propaganda points doesn't even actually have anything to do with pot. Their tireless reliance on such nonsense may go a long way towards explaining why support for legalization is growing faster than ever before. well I guess this shows just how dumb that 46 percent of people really are.They are told something by their government which had no prove of what they were being told and that many people believed it.The Gateway Theory is ,was and always will be wrong,learn to deal it. ""but that there really is no such thing as a gateway drug to begin with. The term was invented by hysterical anti-drug zealots for the specific purpose of linking marijuana with harmful outcomes that couldn't otherwise be established."" How can you not love it when crazy mothers listen to the government propaganda? Seriously, in my opinion as someone who's been there done that, marijuana is not a gateway drug. As I read this article I thought back to my adolescence/young adult years and when smoking I never swayed towards another drug. I don't remember any friends doing it either unless they had already used it. The few times I did sway I was drunk. Alcohol is more of a gateway drug than marijuana. Read up on Alcoholism and the chemical changes that happen in the brain chemistry and you will see why. My point is this, Booze was made legal after the prohibition failed horrifically right?! Yet after decades of research proving that marijuana isn't what the propaganda says it is, it's still illegal. And yes, the average person just blindly follows the propaganda. Hence the 46% against legalization. If people actually get educated on the truths then that percentage would drop dramatically. And please don't get me started about the President and DEA. Especially about certain raids in medicinal marijuana states. The real gateway is prohibition. I absolutely had no desire to use cannabis until I saw how my son was railroaded into two counts of drug paraphernalia. Once I started studying how stupid these laws are I decided to smoke some. After 33 years of not doing it. Now I have been awoken. I,m 58 years old and I've raised 4 tax-payers. I deserve the right to smoke. I suffer from depression. When I light up I can enjoy the moment. I'm tired of using the government sanctioned drug Alcohol and the prescribed LEXAPRO, I want to use the Herb that God gave us. I feel much better. Now after 30 years at work they have piss tests it seems like we can't win!!!!!!! will never change thier minds as they are made up of the folks who profit from your blood being spilled on the streets by murderous police hired by big buisness that want no compiticion to thiere buisnes of selling poisoin to our people .also judges the prison system are to blame.and lastly just a few retards .dispicable proffiters in human misery is what these animals are.

"I'm in a real pickle with a few questions that I cannot seem to find definitive answers for, from either CAP 804 or the CAA. I was hoping some people who have probably gone through the same could help me? I currently hold an NPPL with SLMG and SSEA ratings. In the future I will most probably go down the modular CPL route so am starting to look at ""laying the foundations"". 1. With the EASA changes, how would I now go from an NPPL to a Part FCL PPL? Would I have to go NPPL to LAPL first? I have all the exams and a 150NM XC done, plus the hours with an instructor and instrument appreciation requirement; I believe I just need a class 1/2 medical and another GST? 2. Can I hour build, towards a CPL, on an NPPL in an SSEA / SEP aeroplane and the hours still count when I transition to a Part FCL PPL? (That last one was a tounge twister!) It may be easier for me to keep flying and hour building on my NPPL and convert at a later date, as my license next expires before the phase out of NPPL to LAPL. This one may sound like a silly question but I remember hearing something that the hours will not count when going from NPPL to PPL. 3. Finally, can any SLMG hours be used towards a CPL ? Vigdriver, I have found this from a few years ago: vigdriver wrote: Someone's trying to give you duff info - the Grob 109B is most definately a TMG, see Appendix D to Section F of LASORS. Unfortunately you can only use 30hrs PIC towards the CPL - see D1.2(D) of LASORS. I am a Class Rating Instructor for TMG and SEP types and an RAF instructor on the Grob 109B Vigilant - please feel free to PM me if you want any further info etc... My NPPL was issued with SLMG due to my VGS vigi instructor time. Would the rating on my license have to be TMG for the hours to count (if they even still do under EASA?). I know it's a lot but if I could get all this squared away it would make my life a whole lot easier! I would ring the CAA to confirm (and then post back here so we all know) You can go straight from a NPPL to PPL (well done for doing a 150nm QXC). Hours are hours it doesn't matter if they were obtain on NPPL or PPL. The uk used to count SLMG and TMG hours as exaclty the same and you could count 30 hours towards your CPL requirements. Q1 - NPPL to PPL as long as all items of PPL sylabus have been completed (150nm QXC, Ihr Ex 19 Instruments) then its a PPL test with an examiner. This will involve Navigation, General Handling and Circuits all in ONE flight. Q2 - SSEA - SEP hours are hours for the CPL rating. Q3 - Not going to answer the TMG SLMG question as I dont have my notes to refer to. ",0,0
"Base-Promoted Intermolecular Cyclization of Substituted 3-Aryl ( Heteroaryl ) - 3-chloroacrylaldehydes and Tetrahydroisoquinolines : An Approach to Access Pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines Ziqi Yang , Ning Lu , Zhonglin Wei , Jungang Cao , Dapeng Liang , Haifeng Duan * , and Yingjie Lin * Department of Organic Chemistry , College of Chemistry , Jilin University , Changchun 130012 , P. R. China J. Org . Chem . , Article ASAP DOI : 10.1021 / acs . joc . 6b01781 Publication Date ( Web ) : November 1 , 2016 Copyright © 2016 American Chemical Society OpenURL MASARYK UNIV Abstract We have developed a new base-promoted intermolecular cascade cyclization reaction of substituted 3-aryl ( heteroaryl ) - 3-chloroacrylaldehydes and tetrahydroisoquinolines in one pot . The reaction provides a facile and practical synthesis of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines . A number of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines were synthesized in moderate to high yields ( up to 97 % ) . Pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline ( 1-4 ) ( Scheme 1a ) framework is ubiquitous in various natural products and some biologically active molecules . Representative compounds such as lamellarin D , lamellarin a 20-sulfate , and derivatives crispine A , trolline , and oleracein E are depicted in Scheme 1 . Among them , lamellarin D is a potent inhibitor of human topoisomerase I , ( 5 ) lamellarin a 20-sulfate is an inhibitor of HIV integrase , ( 6 ) and even other lamellarins exhibit anticancer activity ; ( 7-9 ) in addition , crispine A emerged as a target of great interest , due to potential biological and pharmaceutical activities . ( 10 , 11 ) The synthesis of pyrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline derivatives has been the focus of organic chemists' research for a long time . ( 12-18 ) Accordingly , a number of synthetic methods which include metal and metal-free catalysis have been reported . Sequential elegant studies ( Scheme 2 ) using metal catalysis ( e.g. , Ir , Ru , Rh , Ag , Cu , etc. ) were accomplished by several research groups . ( 19-27 ) Scheme 1 . Representative Natural Products Scheme 2 . Existing Strategies for the Synthesis of Pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines In recent years , metal-free catalysis has been of great interest in the construction of the pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline framework . These metal-free catalysis pathways involve stepwise coupling of radicals , which were in situ formed in the presence of t-BuOK / DMF , ( 28 ) or a concerted reaction followed by oxidation in the I2 / H2O2 , ( 29 ) KI / TBHP , ( 30 ) or TBAI / TBHP ( 31 ) system , such as [ 3 + 2 ] cycloaddition between 1 , 4-dicarbonyl-2-butenes and alkyl 2 - ( 3 , 4-dihydroisoquinolin-2 ( 1H ) - yl ) acetates . Although aforementioned successful synthetic methods have been developed , new and facile approaches are still desirable in terms of great structural diversity of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline derivatives . In this context , we developed a new and facile synthetic method for pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines which include an intermolecular cascade cyclization of substituted 3-aryl ( heteroaryl ) - 3-chloroacrylaldehydes and tetrahydroisoquinolines in a one-pot reaction promoted by Et3N / DMF . Initially , the optimal reaction conditions in Yan's work ( 28 ) were also used to examine the reaction of ( Z ) - 3-chloro-3-phenylacrylaldehyde ( 1a ) with THIQ ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4-tetrahydroisoquinoline , 2a ) . Unfortunately , 3-phenyl-5 , 6-dihydropyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinoline ( 4a ) has not been detected , and the substrate 1a was transformed to complex byproducts ( Table 1 , entry 1 ) . Surprisingly , reducing the basicity of inorganic bases is beneficial to the reaction ; for example , when NaOH or K2CO3 was used as the base , the product 4a was obtained in 34 % and 42 % isolated yields respectively ( entries 2 and 3 ) , and 4a was confirmed by crystal structure ( CCDC : 1421171 ; ( 32 ) for more details please see Supporting Information ) . Encouraged by these preliminary results , a variety of organic bases such as DBU ( 1 , 8-diazabicyclo [ 5 . 4 . 0 ] undec-7-ene ) , DABCO ( 1 , 4-diazabicyclo [ 2 . 2 . 2 ] octane ) , DIPEA ( N , N-diisopropylethylamine ) , DMAP ( 4-dimethylaminopyridine ) , TMEDA ( tetramethylethylenediamine ) , and TEA ( trimethylamine ) were used instead of K2CO3 . Obviously , among these bases , TEA gave the best yield ( 56 % , entry 4 ) , and remarkably , DMAP gave us an extreme decrease in yield ( 26 % , entry 8 ) , which might due to DMAP being a weak nucleophile but a strong base . ( 33 ) Thus , we used TEA as the optimal base for further optimization including in the screening of solvents , reaction temperature , additives , and the loading of substrates . As results show in Table 1 , compared with DMF , the high polarity of solvents such as DMSO was also beneficial to the reaction ( 48 % , entry 10 ) ; however , compared with DMF or DMSO , other solvents of relatively low polarity , such as , CH2Cl2 , THF , and CH3CN ( entries 11 , 12 , and 13 ) , gave a trace amount of product 4a . The results showed that the reaction temperature has an apparent effect on the reaction ; both a lower and higher temperature would depress the conversion of substrates ( entries 14 and 15 ) . In addition , some additives such as activated 4 Å molecular sieves and silica or the oxidant MnO2 could not apparently improve the yields ( separately 55 % , 55 % , entries 16 , 17 , and 18 ) ; Gratifyingly , increasing the amount of THIQ and TEA led to a high yield ( 93 % , entry 19 ; for more details , see SI Table 1 ) ; Further experiments exhibited that oxygen had no impact on this reaction in which a radical pathway might not be involved . Ultimately , the optimal reaction conditions identified were as follows : 2.5 equiv of TEA , 4 equiv of THIQ , DMF used as solvent , and a reaction temperature of 120 ° C. Table 1 .

With optimized conditions in hand ( Table 1 , entry 20 ) , we next explored the scope and limitations of this reaction by employing various ( Z ) - 3-aryl ( heteroaryl ) - 3-chloroacrylaldehydes 1 and THIQs 2 ( Scheme 2 ) . An assembly of 20 compounds were synthesized using this protocol and gave the best yield up to 97 % . The results indicated that compounds 1 with electron-withdrawing ( F , Cl , Br , and NO2 ) or electron-donating groups ( Me and OMe ) were well tolerated and provided the corresponding products in moderate to high yields . As shown in Table 2 , when R1 is a meta - or para-substituted group on the phenyl ring , the corresponding product was obtained in a high yield ( up to 97 % , 4e ) . However , ortho-substituents such as F and Br due to their steric hindrance are not beneficial to the reaction ( 34 % 4g and 43 % 4k ) ; surprisingly the substrate which involves ortho-substituent OMe gave a satisfying yield of 71 % ( 4b ) . Substrates with the substituent R2 such as Me and phenyl all provided corresponding products in good to excellent yields respectively ( 84 % 4o and 61 % 4q ) . Table 2 . Scope of Tandem Reactiona Table aReaction conditions : 1a ( 1 . 20 mmol ) , 2a ( 4 . 80 mmol ) , 3a ( 3 . 00 mmol ) , solvent ( 3 mL ) , at 120 ° C 16 h , without Ar protection . Similarly , 1-chloro-3 , 4-dihydronaphthalene-2-carbaldehyde also gave corresponding product 4p in 41 % yield . Subsequently , when condensed 3-aryl - and 3-heteroaryl-substituted 3-chloroacrylaldehydes including naphthalene and thiophene frameworks were subjected to the optimized conditions , products 4r and 4s were obtained in excellent isolated yields ( 89 % and 95 % ) . Finally , 6 , 7-dimethoxy-1 , 2 , 3 , 4-tetrahydroisoquinoline in place of THIQ reacted with 1a ; this reaction also led to the corresponding product 4t in a satisfactory yield ( 77 % ) . Unfortunately , while N-methylbenzylamine and piperidine were used , corresponding products were not detected . To gain insight into the reaction mechanism we performed some additional experiments ( Scheme 3 ) . In experiment A , a mixture of Z and E isomers of 3-chloro-3 - ( 2-fluorophenyl ) acrylaldehyde ( 1gg , Z / E = 1.5 : 1 detected by 1H NMR see SI ) in place of 1g was used to investigate the effect of the E / Z configuration on the reaction . Interestingly , product 4g was obtained in 34 % yield ( Scheme 3A ) . The result is similar to the data for 4g which derived from ( Z ) - 3-chloro-3 - ( 2-fluorophenyl ) acrylaldehyde ( 1g ) used as the substrate in Table 2 and showed that the geometric configuration might have no effect on the reaction result . Compared with ( Z ) - 3-chloro-3-phenylacrylaldehyde ( 1a ) , ( Z ) - 3-bromo-3-phenylacrylaldehyde ( 1aa ) also might undergo the same intermediate step in this protocol and give 4a in a similarly high yield ( 92 % , Scheme 3B ) . In Yan's work , ( 28 ) intramolecular dehydrative coupling of tertiary amines and ketones was promoted by t-BuOK / DMF through a radical process ; ( 34 ) however , under the same conditions , the reaction of ( Z ) - 3-chloro-3-phenylacrylaldehyde ( 1a ) with tetrahydroisoquinoline could not afford corresponding product 4a ( Table 1 , entry 1 ) . In addition , another investigation using TEMPO to catch a possible radical intermediate under an argon atmosphere was not successful , and the product was still obtained in a high yield ( 90 % , Scheme 3C ) . Scheme 3 . Mechanistic Studies Thus , based on these experiment results , a plausible mechanism for this reaction is tentatively proposed in Scheme 4 . Initially , intermediate A was first formed from compounds 1 and 2 via a Michael addition , then nucleophilic substitution between A and THIQ gave an intermediate B under basic conditions . B prompted by TEA was transformed to intermediate C in situ , and then D was generated by 6π-electrocyclization and subsequent elimination of THIQ ( path a ) . Through path b , A was first prompted by TEA to give intermediate E , and then F might be formed through a nucleophilic addition . Final product 4 was generated after the dehydration of F. Scheme 4 . Suggested Mechanism In conclusion , we have developed a new TEA-prompted intermolecular cascade cyclization reaction of substituted 3-aryl ( heteroaryl ) - 3-chloroacrylaldehydes and tetrahydroisoquinolines in one pot . The reaction provides a facile and practical synthesis of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines . A number of pyrrolo [ 2 , 1-a ] isoquinolines were synthesized in moderate to high yields , and the mechanism of the reaction was tentatively proposed .",1,1
"First published on 25 July 2003 The last laugh DOUG Bower , who claims to have been Britain's first crop circle hoaxer , has been on the Marlborough Downs showing a Japanese film crew how it 's done . Mr Bower and his late friend Dave Chorley became famed as Doug and Dave when they claimed ten years ago that they had produced most of the crop circles for many years . The Southampton pair appeared on TV programmes showing how they made the cornfield patterns with trampling devices made from pieces of wood and rope . They managed to achieve the complex patterns , they said , with the aid of wire sights on the peaks of baseball caps . Mr Chorley died a couple of years ago but by that time the pair had long given up going out under the cover of darkness to make crop circles all over the South of England . On Thursday Mr Bower , who is now 79 , showed a Japanese film crew making a documentary how he could still make a crop pattern using the same piece of wood and rope he started out with in the late 1970s . The film company , Media Nations Inc , is making a documentary about Doug and Dave and their claim that they were the first people in the UK to make crop circles . And it paid dozens of local people £ 50 a day to act as extras . At the end of the first day 's filming Mr Bower , an artist and picture framer , told the Gazette that the only crop patterns that could be found until he and Mr Chorley teamed up were simple circles and swirls made by gusts of wind . Mr Bower said he had spent eight years living in Melbourne in Australia . "" It was while I was there in 1962 that I read about three circles appearing on a farm at Tulley in Queensland , "" he said . He returned to England in 1966 to live at Southampton where he opened an art gallery and became friendly with fellow painter Mr Chorley . Mr Bower said : "" We got to know each other well because we had the same interests and were both artists . "" They went out and about together painting on location and , said Mr Bower , it was while walking in fields near Winchester in 1978 that the idea of making crop circles came up in conversation . That was the start of Britain's first crop circle making team . "" Until then all the so-called crop circles had been the result of wind damage , "" said Mr Bower . On evenings over the next 14 years they travelled hundreds of miles from their homes in Southampton to make elaborate patterns in cereal crops as far away as Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire . Meanwhile they sat back and laughed , said Mr Bower , as so called experts began giving reasons for the crop circles ranging from inter-galactic messages to UFO landings . Mr Bower , who is still sprightly , said : "" We went as far as Eastbourne in the east and as far north as Wantage making crop circles at every opportunity we had . "" Sometimes , he said , they would make several in a night before returning home to Southampton by dawn , tired but ecstatic at the way they had the world hoodwinked . He said : "" We made a lot in Wiltshire because that is where the most fuss was being made about them because of the Avebury and Stonehenge link . "" We used to work out the designs on paper so that we knew what we would be doing when we got to a suitable field . "" I still have those original designs which prove how early we started making them . "" Mr Bower said he and his friend used to spend the winter in his studio planning bigger and more complex patterns to make the following summer . "" For 14 years we had everyone fooled , we were the only ones making the patterns although of course we never let on , "" said Mr Bower . He said one reason they continued for so long without telling the world what was causing the mysterious crop pictograms was to poke fun at the establishment and the many so-called experts who expounded serious and complex reasons for the phenomenon . "" We did it for 14 years without anybody being able to prove they were man-made , "" he said . "" Our big reward was in winding up those people who regarded themselves as experts and claimed they knew what was causing them . "" We knew what was causing them , it was us , and at that time we were the only people making them . "" Mr Bower said nowadays there are a number of teams competing to see who can make the biggest and most complex patterns . The documentary was filmed on Richard Hues' land at Stanton St Bernard and the farmer was compensated by the Japanese production company for the damage to his crop . Among those paid to act as extras was Marlborough mum Bryony Sutton and her 20-year-old daughter Rosie . Both had just completed a film making course at Swindon College and were interested in seeing how the professionals worked . Mrs Sutton said : "" The director recruited extras from the Barge Inn at Honeystreet and from some other places and we spent three days filming at Alton Barnes and Stanton St Bernard . "" Rosie played a journalist ostensibly reporting on the crop circle mania . Mrs Sutton said : "" The film crew and the director were all fine , they were very sweet . "" There was a terrible problem though with the language barrier which caused a few difficulties to start with . "" They spoke little English and our Japanese was non existent but it was all a good laugh . "" The programme will be show on Nippon TV in Japan but may be syndicated worldwide .

"On the floor: Classical take on pop Andrew Keoghan, who grew up in Mosgiel, is a songwriter, composer and multi-instrumentalist living in Auckland. He combines his classical training in singing and violin with elements of pop and folk, a fusion which has been described as ""chamber-pop"". He's returning, almost, to his old stomping ground while touring to support his latest release and debut album Arctic Tales Divide, which features 11 songs predominantly recorded at the Lab, Auckland, over the course of four months. The first thing I wanted to know was if, having taken the boy out of Mosgiel, you could take Mosgiel out of the boy. ""I lived in Mosgiel until the age of 12 and I have kept fond memories. I'd run from playing cricket with friends to singing lessons with Mrs Baylis and violin with Mrs Kenevan. We had to uproot quite suddenly when my dad got a job in Christchurch. My then-girlfriend at Mosgiel Intermediate left a 50c lolly mixture in our letterbox the day before we left but I was too shy to call her and say thanks."" The album was produced by Wayne Bell, whose production credits include Jan Hellriegel, Bic Runga and Gin Wigmore. Keoghan plays guitar, piano and violin on the album and is joined by Jol Mulholland (bass and guitar), Wayne Bell (drums, percussion), Victoria Girling-Butcher (vocals) and Ben King (vocals and guitar), with additional input from members of Goodshirt, the Mots, Goldenhorse, Dictaphone Blues and Tim Finn's band. He says it is great to be playing with some of the Auckland music industry's more notable names. "" I was fortunate to have some gifted musicians play on the album and I guess that came about by sharing show billings or through chance encounters, as opposed to any prearranged introductions. Wayne Bell saw a show and said he'd like to produce the album.

Abstract Background Despite the diffusion into practice of percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) in patients with cryptogenic stroke (CS), the benefits have not been demonstrated, and remain unclear. For any individual presenting with a PFO in the setting of CS, it is not clear whether the PFO is pathogenically-related to the index event or an incidental finding. Further, the overall rate of stroke recurrence is low in patients with CS and PFO. How patient-specific factors affect the likelihood that a discovered PFO is related to an index stroke or affect the risk of recurrence is not well understood. These probabilities are likely to be important determinants of the benefits of PFO closure in CS. Design/Methods The goal of the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) Study is to develop and test a set of predictive models that can identify those patients most likely to benefit from preventive treatments for PFO-related stroke recurrence, such as PFO closure. To do this, we will construct a database of patients with CS, both with and without PFO, by combining existing cohort studies. We will use this pooled database to identify patient characteristics associated with the presence (versus the absence) of a PFO, and to use this ""PFO propensity"" to estimate the patient-specific probability that a PFO was pathogenically related to the index stroke (Model #1). We will also develop, among patients with both a CS and a PFO, a predictive model to estimate patient-specific stroke recurrence risk based on clinical, radiographic and echocardiographic characteristics. (Model #2). We will then combine Models #1 and #2 into a composite index that can rank patients with CS and PFO by their conditional probability that their PFO was pathogenically related to the index stroke and the risk of stroke recurrence. Finally, we will apply this composite index to completed clinical trials (currently on-going) testing endovascular PFO closure against medical therapy, to stratify patients from low-expected-benefit to high-expected-benefit. Background Approximately 40% of all strokes are classified as cryptogenic, meaning that the cause is unknown despite an extensive work up [ 1 ]. While patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common and generally benign condition found on autopsy in about 25% of the population [ 2 - 4 ], approximately 40% to 50% of patients younger than age 55 with cryptogenic stroke (CS) have PFO on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) [ 4 - 7 ]. Furthermore, a PFO is found more frequently in patients with CS than in patients with a known cause of stroke, even in the elderly patient [ 7 - 9 ], These association suggest that PFO has an etiological role in CS, presumably via paradoxical emboli (PE) (i.e. venous emboli that gain access to the arterial circulation through a PFO) [ 7 ]. Thus, many physicians will recommend PFO closure in patients, especially younger patients, who have had CS. However, the benefit of PFO closure in patients with CS has not been demonstrated, and remains unclear. First, for a patient presenting with a PFO and a CS, it is not clear for that individual whether the PFO is causally related to the index event or whether it is an incidental finding, since PFOs are so common in the general population. Second, the overall rate of stroke recurrence is relatively low in patients with CS and PFO, ranging in studies from 0% to 12% per year, with an average annualized risk across studies of approximately 2% [ 4 , 5 , 10 ]. Thus, even rare but serious procedure- and device-related complications may be sufficient to nullify the benefit of percutaneous closure, especially if many who receive the device have index strokes unrelated to their PFO. A method is needed to identify patients with CS and pathogenic PFOs, especially those with a high risk of recurrence from patients with CS and incidental PFOs. The theoretical rationale for the RoPE study has been described in prior work [ 7 , 11 ]. Briefly, the RoPE Study builds on prior work demonstrating the potential importance of risk modeling in the interpretation of clinical trials, where overall results may not reflect the benefits to individual patients [ 12 - 17 ]. In the setting of CS specifically, we have shown that the probability that an individual will have a PFO can be predicted (i.e. prior to TEE) based on the presence or absence of conventional stroke risk factors (e.g. age, presence of hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, etc.) and other characteristics. We call the patient-specific probability of finding a PFO in the setting of CS the ""PFO propensity"". Using simple assumptions and Bayes' theorem, PFO propensity can be shown to be directly but not linearly related to the patient-specific PFO-attributable fraction (i.e. the probability that the PFO is pathogenic rather than incidental)-- as shown in the Figure 1 . Thus, although it is not possible in the individual patient to determine with certainty whether a discovered PFO is incidental or pathogenic, it is nonetheless possible to construct mathematical models that can stratify patients by their likelihood that their stroke is PFO-related. Figure 1. PFO Propensity and the Probability that a Stroke is PFO-attributable . We define PFO propensity as the probability of finding a PFO in a patient, based on patient-specific characteristics (such as age and the presence or absence of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia). Through Bayes' theorem, it is directly (though non-linearly) related to the probability that a cryptogenic stroke is PFO-attributable (in patients with both cryptogenic stroke and PFO). Additionally, while prior studies have had limited statistical power to develop predictive models that can predict stroke recurrence given the low frequency of this outcome, the RoPE Study aims to overcome this barrier by combining multiple large multicentered studies to yield a pooled database with a sufficient number of cerebrovascular outcome events to model recurrence risk. The aim of the RoPE Study is to develop mathematical models that can be used to stratify patients by the joint probability that an index stroke is ""PFO-related"" and that the stroke will recur and to use these models to stratify patients in on-going clinical trials testing percutaneous closure, with the goal of informing patient-selection for PFO closure in clinical practice. The steps by which this will be accomplished are summarized in Figure 2 , as well as in the specific aims below. Design/Methods 1. To construct from existing cohort studies of patients with CS studied with TEE, both with and without PFO, the largest extant CS database, sufficiently robust to support predictive risk modeling. 2. To identify patient characteristics associated with the presence (versus the absence) of a PFO, and to use this ""PFO propensity"" to estimate the patient-specific probability that a PFO was pathogenically related to the index stroke. (Model #1) 3. To develop a predictive model to estimate patient-specific stroke recurrence risk based on clinical, radiographic and echocardiographic characteristics in patients with PFO and CS. (Model #2) 4. To develop a composite index based on Models #1 & #2 that can rank patients with CS and PFO by their conditional probability that the PFO was pathogenically related to the index stroke (Model #1) and the risk of stroke recurrence (Model #2). 5. To apply this composite index to patients in completed clinical trials (currently on-going) testing endovascular PFO closure against medical therapy, to stratify them from low-expected-benefit to high-expected-benefit. Aim 1: To construct the largest extant CS database from existing cohort studies of patients with CS studied with TEE for the presence/absence of PFO Methods for pooling multiple independent studies have been previously described [ 18 , 19 ]. Steps include: 1) selection of participating clinical trials and databases; 2) development of a collaborative investigative team including clinicians, statisticians and programmers; 3) preliminary determination of the availability and characteristics of data in each of the component databases; 4) complete specification of the dependent (outcome) variable used in each study and in the pooled analyses; 5) determination and specification of the independent (explanatory) variables; 6) specification of the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the studies; 7) verification of variable definitions; 8) acquisition of new data if required; 9) checking for consistency of effects across study databases. Based on our own literature search, a published literature review [ 4 ], and then subsequently on a published meta-analysis [ 10 ], we contacted all investigators with relevant data examining the rate of recurrent stroke in patients CS and PFO. This also yielded data examining the presence/absence of PFO in patients with CS. We obtained agreements to include 13 databases with over 2500 subjects, as shown in Table 1 . This provides the basis of our power calculations for subsequent aims. Precise determination of inclusion/exclusion criteria, specification of the independent variables and specification of the dependent variable for each of the models are dependent on careful examination of each of the component databases for details of variable definition and missingness. s Consensus on the variables will be reached among RoPE Investigators for the final models. Provisional variable descriptions are provided below. The RoPE Study will include patients with CS who have been examined for the presence of a PFO with either TEE or Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and the injection of bubbles. The preliminary definition of CS for the RoPE Study conforms to the Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification, [ 20 ] and requires a ""complete work-up"" (defined below) for the cause of the stroke. Cardioembolic stroke in this classification was considered ""probable"" if there was a high-risk source of embolism and ""possible"" for medium risk sources. This latter category includes PFO and atrial septal aneurysms (ASA). For the purposes of the RoPE Study, subjects with medium risk sources will be considered cryptogenic. The definition of stroke for the RoPE Study is ""a sudden onset neurological deficit in a vascular territory presumed to be due to focal ischemia ."" If the deficit lasts for less than 24 hours, it must be accompanied by acute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computer tomography (CT) changes in appropriate locations. If the deficit is greater than 24 hours, MRI or CT changes are not required. A ""complete work-up"" must include: 1) MRI or CT; 2) Vascular imaging - catheter angiography or angiography by MRI or CT; 3) Cardiac rhythm study: at least one electrocardiography (ECG), or documented Holter or telemetry. In addition to excluding patients with stroke of known cause, patients included in the RoPE study must be worked up for the presence of a PFO with a TEE using intravenous injection of bubbles. Patients can be included in model #1 without a TEE, if they have had both transthoracic echocardiography [to rule out other potential cardioembolic sources] and TCD with bubbles (to establish the presence/absence of right-to-left shunting). Only patients with a TEE will be included in Model #2, since this model will require assessment of the presence/absence of ASA and PFO grading. Table 2 shows provisional independent (predictor) variables that we anticipate will be important in both the prediction of the presence/absence of PFO, and also the risk of the outcome (recurrent ischemic stroke, as defined above). Of note, we anticipate that harmonization of databases may require the acquisition of new primary data, potentially from the following sources: 1) medical record review 2) rereading of TEE tapes; 3) rereading of neuroimages; 4) obtaining follow-up for recurrent events. In general, the reasons for needing additional primary data from a particular database may include: 1) missing data on a portion of patients; 2) differing variable definitions between databases; and 3) new data (variables) required not previously collected in a given database. Medical record review would be possible for clinical registries and TEE tapes and neuroimages are potentially available for most of the component databases. Based on the characteristics of any observed missing data we will investigate the use of imputation and replacement algorithms, or whether a component database needs to be excluded--although statistical methods to preserve data and power will be fully employed (such as imputation for independent variables). Because missingness of the dependent (outcome) variable poses more potential problems due to informative censoring, we intend to exclude any datasets for which less than 90% of patients have follow-up at one year. Re-adjudication of all stroke outcomes is planned as part of the RoPE study. Methods ensuring database quality during database construction will be complemented by steps taken during the predictive modeling process to check for consistency of effects across databases. Aim 2: To identify patient characteristics associated with the presence (versus the absence) of a PFO, and to use this ""PFO propensity"" to estimate the patient-specific probability that a PFO was pathogenically related to the index stroke. (Model #1) Since PFOs discovered in patients with CS may be pathogenically related to the stroke or not, in Aim 2, we will use logistic regression models to identify patient characteristics that are associated with the presence of a PFO among patients with CS (""PFO propensity""). In previous work [ 7 , 11 , 21 ], we have shown that this ""PFO propensity"" can be related to the probability that a PFO is pathogenic (i.e. non-incidental) using Bayes' theorem and 2 simple assumptions: 1) if not for those strokes that are PFO-attributable, the probability of a PFO in a CS patient would be the same as in the general population (controls); and 2) the rate of PFO-attributable strokes in PFO-negative CS patients is near-zero. Under these conditions: Since the patient-specific probability of PFO in CS is given by the PFO propensity (i.e. the prevalence of PFO in CS patients otherwise similar to the patient), the only additional term needed to estimate the probability that a PFO is incidental for a particular patient is the general rate of PFO in the population (PFO probability in controls). To develop a predictive model for PFO propensity, we will explore crude associations (overall and within each database) between the presence of a PFO and clinical variables including the subject's age, gender, race, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, history of prior episodes of cerebral ischemia, obesity, antithrombotic medications, concurrent deep venous thrombosis, and neuroradiologic variables (i.e. prior stroke on MRI or CT, small [&lt; 1.5 cm] versus large infarct, location of infarct). Multivariable associations between predictors and the presence of a PFO will be examined using logistic regression models. Selection of candidate variables for these models will be based on clinical rationale and the published literature. Variables with statistically marginal associations in the preliminary analyses (p &gt; 0.15) will be removed. Non-linear associations between independent risk variables and the outcome will be investigated using generalized additive spline models [ 22 ]. As indicated, appropriate parametric logistic regression models will be developed to capture these non-linear relationships. Statistical significance of individual variables in the final model will be assessed with the Score statistic. Based on clinical reasoning, a limited number of interaction terms between risk factors may also be tested for inclusion in the model. The models will be analyzed by conventional criteria, such as goodness-of-fit tests, and receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve areas [ 23 ]. ""Calibration"" of predicted probabilities of outcome throughout the range of their predictions will be evaluated with plots. The final multivariable regression models will be run separately on each of the component datasets to assess the consistency of the results and model performance. Based on these results, interaction terms between indicator variables representing study and model predictors of PFO will be used to investigate significant variation in associations across study datasets. Predictors found to be inconsistent across studies may be removed from the model. We will reanalyze the data using a generalized linear mixed model that includes a random effect term for study to get final parameter estimates with their corresponding standard errors. Adequacy of the Data for Aim 2: Based on a preliminary review of the included studies (see Table 1 ), we will have potentially 3,101 subjects available for the models predicting PFO (1,332 with and 1,769 without PFOs), drawn only from those databases enrolling all cryptogenic stroke patients with and without PFO. This sample size will provide 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.23 for a balanced risk factor. For a risk factor with a prevalence of 20%, this sample size will still provide 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.29. The study will still provide sufficient power to detect clinically relevant associations even in the presence of significant data being unavailable for modeling. For example, if we totally eliminate data from the largest RoPE component study (the German database [ 24 ]), we will have 1,975 included subjects (928 with and 1047 without PFOs.) This sample will provide 80% power to detect odds ratios of 1.29 and 1.38 for risk factors with a prevalence of 0.50 and 0.20, respectively. Since outcome data is not needed for this analysis, loss of this amount of data is unlikely and the database would anyway still have ample power, permitting full exploration of multiple variables. Aim 3. To develop a predictive model to estimate patient-specific recurrence risk based on clinical, radiographic and echocardiographic characteristics in patients with PFO and CS. (Model #2) For Aim 3 we will use Cox proportional hazard models to develop a predictive model to estimate patient-specific recurrence risk. Because patients with CS with higher PFO-related recurrence risk generally have a lower prevalence of conventional stroke risk factors [ 25 ], failure to adjust for general (non-PFO-related) recurrent risk can lead to paradoxical results. This has been a major challenge for prior studies, since the low rate of outcomes limits the statistical power to control for conventional stroke risk factors and model PFO-related risk. While in the RoPE study we will have many-fold the number of outcomes compared to any prior study, statistical power for this analysis remains an issue. To address this, depending in part on the number of outcomes, we will consider a two-step approach, that takes advantage of the outcomes in the component of the RoPE database of CS patients without PFO. First, we will construct a model for recurrence risk on the component of the study of CS patients without PFO. Next, we will construct a model for recurrence risk on the component of the study of CS patients with PFO, using the derived risk variable from the first step to control for the confounding background risk of stroke from PFO-unrelated causes. This will permit background stroke risk to be controlled for in a statistically efficient fashion. For step two, using the study subjects with known PFO, we will pay particular attention to echocardiographic information (e.g. hypermobility of the interatrial septum, interatrial shunting at rest, severity of interatrial shunt, anatomical PFO size, presence/absence of spontaneous flow on color Doppler)--to identify features of ""high-risk"" PFOs. Preliminary analyses for both phases of this two step process (i.e. modeling recurrence risk in patients without PFO and modeling recurrence risk in patients with PFO) will investigate associations between established risk factors and recurrent strokes. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and logrank tests will be used to assess statistical significance. For each phase, a multivariable prediction model for recurrent stroke will be developed using a Cox proportional hazard model, using an approach otherwise similar to that described for Aim 2. Predictive discrimination will be assessed using the overall C index [ 26 ]. Model calibration is assessed by comparing predicted survival probabilities against Kaplan-Meier (observed) probabilities across equal-sized risk quantiles (based on predicted recurrence probabilities). Differences between predicted and observed probabilities will be compared using a modified Hosmer-Lemeshow ? 2 statistic [ 27 ]. The Cox models be re-run including the study as a stratification factor to control for potential between-study differences in baseline survival functions when estimating hazard ratios of potential risk factors. Adequacy of the data for Aim 3: Power was calculated on extreme optimistic and extreme pessimistic calculations. To obtain outcome rates for our sample we used databases with patients who had PFOs. We optimistically estimate available follow-up data for up to 1,752 patients with PFO; 1,332 from databases with both PFO and non-PFO patients and an additional 420 from databases that only have data on patients with PFOs. Based on the average outcome rates on the observed data, the estimated stroke rate for these patients is 6%. The sample size of 1,752 will provide 80% power to detect a clinically relevant hazard ratio of 1.77 for a risk factor with a prevalence of 50% and an overall stroke rate of 6%. Most pessimistically, we excluded 100% of our largest study (the German study [ 24 ]) and estimated follow-up will only be available for 70% of the remaining subjects which would result in a total sample size of 944. With this extremely conservative estimate of the sample size the study will have 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.22 assuming an overall stroke rate of 6% and a risk factor prevalence of 50%. While having a sample size toward this lower estimate would still be adequate to detect these moderate to large effects, it would require us to be parsimonious in testing variables to avoid over-fitting (only about 60 stroke outcomes in PFO patients). After final database construction, we will consider whether to model the risk of the composite outcome stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This has an outcome rate of 11.2% on the sample of our database with completed follow-up, virtually doubling the number of outcomes. Aim 4. To develop a composite index that can rank patients with CS and PFO by their conditional probability that the PFO was pathogenically-related to the index stroke (Model #1) and the risk of stroke recurrence (Model #2) For Aim 4, we will combine our probability models in order to stratify patients by their risk of stroke recurrence conditioned on the probability that the PFO is pathogenically-related (i.e. not incidental) to the index stroke. Thus, the aim of this step is to combine models to estimate the PFO-attributable recurrence risk. This step prepares us for Aim 5: stratification of the clinical trial populations by this attributable recurrence risk, which we hypothesize corresponds to stratification by expected-benefit. In performing Aim 5, it is important to recognize that subgroup analyses are prone to false positive results due to multiple comparisons. Indeed, an advantage of multivariable risk-based analysis is that it allows the influence of multiple variables to be summarized along a single dimension and thus minimize the risks of this Type I error. However, this is only the case if the stratification is fully specified, before the outcomes are examined, since even with a single risk model minor differences in stratification can influence results; when two risk models are combined, the potential for analytic flexibility-and therefore bias--is increased. While this Aim needs to be informed by the results of Aims 2 and 3, and the observed risk distributions in the RoPE populations, to emphasize the importance of full pre -specification of the stratification strategy, process and analysis before the outcome data of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are examined, we have partitioned this into a separate specific aim, to be completed before Aim 5. A challenge of this step is that transformation of PFO propensity into a probability that a PFO is pathogenic versus incidental requires an estimate of the rate of PFO in a control population. The control rates of TEE-detected PFOs vary somewhat from study to study, presumably due to variation in TEE technique (since the presence of a PFO rates have been shown to be largely independent of patient characteristics in unselected [screened] populations [ 25 , 28 ]. Figure 1 shows the relationship of PFO propensity to the probability that a PFO is pathogenic under the assumptions that the control PFO rate is 15%, 20% and 25%. While the ranking of patients according to their probability that their PFO is pathogenically related to their index event is insensitive to the exact control rate selected, to converge on a control rate that would allow us to combine models #1 and #2, we will: 1) perform meta-analysis of control groups in prior case-control studies (CS versus non-cryptogenic stroke patients); 2) analyze the PFO-rate in TEE-studied non-cryptogenic stroke patients in component RoPE studies that included such patients (such as PICSS, which has 365 TEE-studied non-cryptogenic stroke patients). We will explore the distribution of the patient-specific probability that the discovered PFO is pathogenic across the different strata of the RoPE population. Once the models are combined to produce the probability of stroke recurrence conditional on the probability that the index event was PFO-related (i.e. PFO-attributable recurrence risk), and based on a thorough understanding of the risk profile of the patients in the RoPE population and the randomized clinical trial population (but prior to any analysis of outcomes in the RCTs), the full stratification plan will be specified, as provisionally outlined in Aim 5. The primary hypothesis of Aim 5 is that there will be a treatment-by-index interaction, when patients enrolled in RCTs testing PFO closure are ranked by their risk of stroke recurrence, conditioned on the probability that the PFO was pathogenically-related to the index event (using the composite index as a continuous variable). A p-value of 0.05 will be the threshold for significance. Depending on results, a clinically usable model will be developed. This step comprises external validation of the combined model. In addition, model 2 (the CS recurrence risk model) will be externally validated on the pooled medical arms of the RCTs by conventional criteria, including goodness-of-fit tests, ROC curve areas and calibration plots as described in the prior aims. For Aim 5, we have, as of this writing, received agreement to test the risk models on two RCT databases, which will be pooled. Additional RCTs will be sought. The two RCTs to be pooled are: Randomized Evaluation of Recurrent Stroke comparing PFO Closure to Established Current Standard of Care Treatment (RESPECT) Trial: ( http://ClinicalTrials.gov webcite identifier: NCT00465270) This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center trial, enrolling at 60 North American centers, designed to investigate whether percutaneous PFO closure with the Amplatzer PFO Occluder is superior to current standard of care medical treatment in the prevention of recurrent stroke. Inclusion criteria include age of 18-60 years old, cryptogenic stroke (not TIA) within 270 days, and TEE demonstration of a PFO. The recruitment target is 1000 subjects who will be randomized 1:1 to endovascular PFO closure or medical management. The primary endpoints are recurrence of non-fatal stroke, post-randomization death, and fatal ischemic stroke. PC-Trial: Patent Foramen Ovale and Cryptogenic Embolism: (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00166257). The PC-Trial is very similar in design to the RESPECT Trial comparing the efficacy of percutaneous PFO closure with medical treatment in 26 European centers. An additional inclusion criterion is cryptogenic peripheral embolism. Subjects are being stratified according to age and presence or absence of an atrial septal aneurysm. The recruitment target is 410 and the primary outcome is death, non-fatal stroke and peripheral embolism [ 29 ]. Adequacy of the Data for Aim 5: The proposed sample of 1400 subjects from RESPECT and the PC-Trial will provide sufficient power to detect a moderate interaction in the association of the recurrent risk stratification and the two study treatment groups. Power was estimated through simulations in SAS across multiple parameter configurations. For example, the proposed study sample of 700 subjects in each study arm, with an overall recurrence rate of 5% (stroke only), will provide approximately 80% power to detect a difference in the hazard ratio for a change of 10% in predicted risk of 1.00 and 1.33 for the two study groups, assuming a uniform distribution of risk scores. Additional RCTs will also be sought. Competing interests Drs. Kent and Thaler have no conflict of interests to report.

"How a candidate is elected for one vacancy If there is only one position available (e.g. a mayoralty) and there are only two candidates, the election will always be decided on the first preference votes, in just the same way as a first-past-the-post election. If there is only one position available, and more than two candidates, STV works like this: Setting the quota (called an absolute majority) The quota needed to get elected in an election for one vacancy is half the votes being counted (technically, half the votes, plus a fraction). The quota is recalculated whenever votes can't be transferred (for example because the vote expresses only one preference, and the voting has progressed to second preferences). Deciding an outcome on the count of first preferences If a candidate gets more than half the first preference votes, that candidate will be elected. Votes will not need to be transferred to second and later preferences to decide the outcome because a candidate has already reached the quota. Deciding an outcome if no one wins on the count of first preferences If there are more than two candidates for a single position, it may be necessary to go only to second-preference candidates to decide a winner. This is done by excluding the lowest-polling candidate and transferring the second-preference votes of those who supported that candidate to other candidates. After this is done, if the vote for one of the candidates is higher than the quota, that candidate is elected. However, even after the second preferences of voters for the lowest-polling candidate are transferred, it may be that no candidate has reached the quota. If this is the case, the next lowest-polling candidate is excluded, and the second-preference votes for that candidate are transferred to those who have not been excluded. But some of those second-preference votes may be for the candidate who was excluded first. In this case, these votes are transferred to the third preferences of those voters. This continues until a candidate reaches the quota. The computer system used ensures that the order in which votes are counted does not affect the outcome. Equal votes If, on any count, two or more candidates have an equal number of votes and one of them has to be excluded, the electoral officer determines which candidate had the fewest votes the first time the candidates' totals were different and excludes the candidate with the lowest total votes. Ties If the candidates had an equal number of votes at all stages of the count, a random (or pseudo-random) process is used to choose which candidate is excluded. Example one One position Two candidates 10,000 votes 5,500 first preferences for candidate A 4,500 first preferences for candidate B The quota is 10,000 divided by (1+1) = 5,000 The total first preference votes for candidate A of 5,500 is greater than the quota of 5,000 therefore: Candidate A is elected. There is no need to include second preferences. Example two One position Four candidates 10,000 votes 5,250 first preferences for candidate A 3,500 first preferences for candidate B 750 first preferences for candidate C 500 first preferences for candidate D The quota is 10,000 divided by (1+1) = 5,000 The total of first preference votes for candidate A of 5,250 is greater than the quota of 5,000 therefore: Candidate A is elected. There is no need to include second preferences. Example three One position Four candidates 10,000 votes 3,500 first preferences for candidate A 2,500 first preferences for candidate B 3,000 first preferences for candidate C 1,000 first preferences for candidate D The quota is 10,000 divided by (1+1) = 5,000 No candidate's first preference votes are greater than the quota of 5,000 therefore The lowest polling candidate (D) is excluded and the second preferences of the 1000 voters who voted for that candidate are transferred to the 3 remaining candidates. This results in: 4,000 first preferences and transferred votes for candidate A 2,750 first preferences and transferred votes candidate B 3,250 first preferences and transferred votes for candidate C 0 votes for candidate D, as all votes for this candidate have been transferred to the other candidates No candidate's vote is greater than the quota of 5,000 therefore The next lowest polling candidate (B) is excluded and the second preferences of those who voted for that candidate are transferred to the 2 remaining candidates. Where the second preferences were for candidate D, who has already been excluded, votes are transferred to voters' third preferences. This results in: 5,750 first preferences and transferred votes for candidate A 0 for candidate B, as all votes for this candidate have been transferred to other candidates 4,250 first preferences and transferred votes for candidate C 0 votes for candidate D, as all votes for this candidate have been transferred to other candidates The 5,750 votes for candidate A is more than the quota of 5,000, therefore: Candidate A is elected. NOTE: For elections with more than four candidates for a single position, the process continues in the same way until a candidate reaches the quota. ",2,2
"babble is rabble.ca's discussion board but it's much more than that: it's an online community for folks who just won't shut up. It's a place to tell each other -- and the world -- what's up with our work and campaigns. Think Left, Invest Left: How to do that? We've all read the criticisms, too many to really go about noting, where Left-seeming supposed progressive politicians make promises to Leftist goals but then turn around and put money into far Right investments. I'm speaking of an issue that is constantly passed around like a wobbly chair that people are afraid to really sit at, an issue that goes past the criticism of right wing business ventures and into progressive oriented investments. I see this issue in two ways first off in our current capitalist state, and it is the same with many other countries. We have private investments, public investments, and come hybrid combination of the two , which are called public private partnerships (PPPs). What I want to address here though is the private investment section for a minute because it often seems like that gets little attention sometimes by activists, where somewhat there seems to be a sort of visceral indigestion with having to get wrapped up in the greedy, selfish and vapid world of stock markets and other markets. What I am concerned with is that it seems that politicians can play this farce where they fake left but turn right when it comes to economic projects, and so I now ask myself, being a little older and having trouble acquiring the small amount I do have, while wanting to go to college and possibly incur a little debt through a loan there, that what can I do withthe money I've saved that would make me more money in the future by investing it in ethical industries, which may not have the same growth spikes as the more cancerous industries, but I would have peace of mind and in the end understand perhaps the sustainable development goals better in both an environmental and a financial sense. I've read a little for instance about solar energy and wind enrgy companies and then looked them up on the stock market only to find that they are doing horribly. I'm wondering if high-speed rail is a solid bet, which some investment does seem to suggest, and most importantly from an ethical perspective, high-speed rail is more energy saving for people if they can be coaxed off cars and into this system. California is planning to build a high-speed rail is it not? I know that some of these companies have legs and arms in other ventures that are not noble like Bombardier for example, so I would either want to not go there, or go there in terms of an isolated division that makes air-brakes specific to high-speed rail for example. Please note that my high speed rail example is just an example and not the bulwark of some industry I'm trying to defend here. What I'm trying to do is lay out some examples so that anyone reading this can get a sense of the parameters of the economic issue I am addressing. Perhaps there are solid solar and wind energy companies, this I would want to know too. In fact what I want is the biggest most elaborate list of research information possible. Send me a billion relevant links alright? Just try and keep it bs free. Thanks! Comments But then I try to look into the SRIs suggested like Meritas/OceanRock http://www.qtrade.ca/orFundProfilesOV.do\\... , and I'm left scratching my head somewhat as to what exactly ethically Meritas is doing in Funds like this Money Market Fund from Meritas that contributes 2% to community development assistance but then has Enbridge as one of its top ten holdings? This bs seems like the fund is just mainstaining the status of a SRI merely by fitting in with some incredibly unreliable definitions of ""socailly responsible."" The community development is good but Enbridge seems bad if you ask me. Here's corresponding links to cite this example: http://www.qtrade.ca/orFundProfilesOV.do\\... (under the tab fund information you will find various questionable holdings like Enbridge) I've read a little about Socially Responsible Investments (SRIs) but some that I've found I'm not overall sure about, I do want to rule out oil for sure, so like no fossil fuels, and I think I found a Scotia Bank one that touted being an SRI but didn't really seem like all that much of one. Like how do the Scotia bank ones stand up?: http://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/0,,393,0\\... I'm by no means an expert at this stuff but some of it seems fairly obvious when you're trying to track down their good deeds aside from their mandates and those lame overview statements they provide about what their funds stand for, rhetorically speaking that is. I really would like some feedback, and if you think it is next to impossible to do some of this stuff, please explain that too. If you think I am digging down the wrong tunnel please say that rather than skip over this babble entry and not saying a thing. I somewhat imagine that some of the reasons for poor stock performance in some wind and solar energy may have little to do with true bad performace but may be due to a lack of sufficient funding to get the real depth of the project implemented that is necessary to start making a return on profits. There are plausible reasons why ethical investing may not be functional due to lack of funding to get a project off the ground, that easily is supplied to more readily returnable profit to shareholder companies like those involved in tar sands energy for example. Provide some feedback please. You know in a number of ways this ethics of investments goes to the heart of society's blind trust that led to this financial crisis of gouging customers and ripping the face off clients type stuff, stuff like pension money going into harmful industries -- our misunderstanding of the business we invest in. The election in America and the ambivalence surrounding the difference between Obama and Romney, as progressives break down the matter, is very central to misleading clients (the citizens of America in terms of public programs are clients also), where Obama flat out lied by stressing issues in his 2008 campaign speech taht he never honored. Matt Stoller from Salon has a good write up: The policy continuity with Bush is a stark contrast to what Obama offered as a candidate. Look at the broken promises from the 2008 Democratic platform: a higher minimum wage, a ban on the replacement of striking workers, seven days of paid sick leave, a more diverse media ownership structure, renegotiation of NAFTA, letting bankruptcy judges write down mortgage debt, a ban on illegal wiretaps, an end to national security letters, stopping the war on whistle-blowers, passing the Employee Free Choice Act, restoring habeas corpus , and labor protections in the FAA bill. Each of these pledges would have tilted bargaining leverage to debtors, to labor, or to political dissidents. So Obama promised them to distinguish himself from Bush, and then went back on his word because these promises didn't fit with the larger policy arc of shifting American society toward his vision. For sure, Obama believes he is doing the right thing, that his policies are what's best for society. He is a conservative technocrat, running a policy architecture to ensure that conservative technocrats like him run the complex machinery of the state and reap private rewards from doing so. Radical political and economic inequality is the result. None of these policy shifts, with the exception of TARP, is that important in and of themselves, but together they add up to declining living standards . Then on the other hand, Romney we call the etch-a-sketch, for his speaking out of two mouths at the same time contradicting himself on the campaign trail, and we call this deceitful because it is happening in a closer space of time, this contradicting values by Romney but yet it is fair for Obama to do this by lying consistently throughout a campaign and then later on selling out to the public. How little we seem to care about the actual ventures they are on, exhibiting a sort of blind faith the rhetorical spinner of good deeds is better than the guy who sort of tells you that profits are the ultimate good. My question then is are SRIs better than buying directly in Enbridge because they can hide holdings of companies like Enbridge within other entities that hide these interests, as do SRIs by complying with flimsy standards on social investment that allow oil companies to still make the grade while speeding up global warming and harming local communities upset by oil operations like in the tar sands for example. You know, maybe ethical choices despite everything else is best. Perhaps this would mean in AMerica that Jill Stein of the Green Party is the true ethical choice because they will use their funds honestly and are geared towards actual transparency and accountability, auditing, regulations -- all that stuff talked about that we're so often used to hearing sold in the way you sell your kids the lies of Santa Claus and the Easter bunny. What in effect are real investment answers that are good and ethical that are not the lesser of two evils or the better of the bunch or framed in ways like that, but actually just good stuff for a healthy planet?

"In Virtue , Edwards describes his views on the different levels of virtue , specifically ""common morality "" and ""true (saving) virtue."" [ 1 ] God , Edwards argues, had in mind as the end for his creation of the world His own glory and not human happiness. Thus, true virtue does not arise from self-love or from any earth-bound selflessness (these were two common views at the time) but from a desire to see God's glory displayed above all. Love of self, family, or nation is good only to the extent that it magnifies the glory of God. [ 2 ] The Nature of True Virtue , and its companion work, A Dissertation Concerning the End for Which God Created the World , are still popular works today. Modern theologian John Piper , who extensively studied the works of Edwards while at Seminary , credits the work with awakening in him a ""a deep longing to be a good man."" [ 3 ] ",1,1
"Now I don't know about you, but when I was a nipper, some thirty or so years ago, the world seemed a far bigger, warmer and more straightforward place than it is now (probably due to the fact I was then much smaller, hardier and less cynical). I'm not normally given over to this sort of nostalgic humbug (nostalgia isn't what it used to be, as Peter De Vries once said) but after looking at Ofcom's data about children's media habits I can't help thinking of my own childhood experiences back in the day when there were only three TV channels and remote control of the goggle box involved hurling a slipper at the on/off switch. As Mark Cuban pointed out in a recent post , we don't live in the world we were born into, and the Ofcom data bring this point home forcefully. It's true that some things remain the same (like the worst warmongering instincts of our politicians, and the fact that an umbrella is essential for anyone holidaying in the UK), and other things are at least recognisable from period to period (thirty years ago a diminished Labour administration was stumbling towards defeat...). But one thing's for sure: communication technology has changed beyond all recognition during the last three decades, and with it the ways we interact with each other, share information and amuse ourselves. My children's experience of the world is undoubtedly different to mine in this respect, and Ofcom's data provide  intriguing evidence of these shifts. For one thing, the figures reported by Ofcom confirm what we know about the prevalence of TV in children's lives, but they also show how diverse their media activity has become (see Figure 2.99). It seems that watching videos/DVDs is a regular activity for around two fifths of children aged 5 to 15, and there is little variation by age group. In contrast, regular internet use rises dramatically with age; fewer than a quarter (22%) of 5-7 year olds use the internet regularly compared with two thirds (66%) of 12-15 year olds. Regular mobile phone use shows an even starker increase, rising from just 4% of 5-7 year olds to 70% of 12-15 year olds. Now consider the data reported in Figure 2.105 (below). Despite the frequency of TV viewing among 5-15 year olds, only around 30% of those at the older end of the age scale (12-15) said of all the media activities available to them they would miss watching TV most of all if it was taken away. Almost as large a proportion of boys in this group (27%) would miss playing computer or video games the most, a proportion that falls to only 3% of girls aged 12-15. Girls of this age were much more likely to miss using their mobile phone, sociable creatures that they are. Note that hardly any children aged 12-15 would miss watching videos or DVDs the most. It must, therefore, be considered a desirable activity rather than an essential one by the 40% who regularly watch DVDs, possibly due to the fact that the fun of DVD viewing is only sustainable if new titles are available, which in turn costs money (or depends on the generosity of others). To economically dependent youngsters, video game titles offering 30+ hours of entertainment and the prospect of competitive fun within the peer group, or the internet's promise of infinite diversion, are probably seen as better value than one-hit wonder DVDs. Within only a few years time these mobile phone wielding, social networking, internet surfing, video game playing children will be chased hard by film marketers and sellers. This makes another compelling reason for the movie business model to migrate online and embrace convergence by offering casual viewers cheap (e.g. free, advertising-supported) online film services to be enjoyed on demand. Only then can the desirable activity of watching movies become an essential part of young people's wired life.

"Epilogue I Siberia . On the banks of a broad solitary river stands a town , one of the administrative centres of Russia ; in the town there is a fortress , in the fortress there is a prison . In the prison the second-class convict Rodion Raskolnikov has been confined for nine months . Almost a year and a half has passed since his crime . There had been little difficulty about his trial . The criminal adhered exactly , firmly , and clearly to his statement . He did not confuse nor misrepresent the facts , nor soften them in his own interest , nor omit the smallest detail . He explained every incident of the murder , the secret of the pledge ( the piece of wood with a strip of metal ) which was found in the murdered woman's hand . He described minutely how he had taken her keys , what they were like , as well as the chest and its contents ; he explained the mystery of Lizaveta's murder ; described how Koch and , after him , the student knocked , and repeated all they had said to one another ; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay and Dmitri shouting ; how he had hidden in the empty flat and afterwards gone home . He ended by indicating the stone in the yard off the Voznesensky Prospect under which the purse and the trinkets were found . The whole thing , in fact , was perfectly clear . The lawyers and the judges were very much struck , among other things , by the fact that he had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone , without making use of them , and that , what was more , he did not now remember what the trinkets were like , or even how many there were . The fact that he had never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed incredible . There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and seventeen roubles and sixty copecks . From being so long under the stone , some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the damp . They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man should tell a lie about this , when about everything else he had made a truthful and straightforward confession . Finally some of the lawyers more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really not looked into the purse , and so did n't know what was in it when he hid it under the stone . But they immediately drew the deduction that the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental derangement , through homicidal mania , without object or the pursuit of gain . This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary insanity , so often applied in our days in criminal cases . Moreover Raskolnikov's hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses , by Dr. Zossimov , his former fellow students , his landlady and her servant . All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not quite like an ordinary murderer and robber , but that there was another element in the case . To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion , the criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself . To the decisive question as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery , he answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was his miserable position , his poverty and helplessness , and his desire to provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand roubles he had reckoned on finding . He had been led to the murder through his shallow and cowardly nature , exasperated moreover by privation and failure . To the question what led him to confess , he answered that it was his heartfelt repentance . All this was almost coarse .... The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected , perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself , but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt . All the strange and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration . There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition of the criminal at the time . The fact that he had made no use of what he had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse , partly to his abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime . Incidentally the murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis : a man commits two murders and forgets that the door is open ! Finally , the confession , at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism , and when , moreover , there were no proofs against the real criminal , no suspicions even ( Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word ) -- all this did much to soften the sentence . Other circumstances , too , in the prisoner's favour came out quite unexpectedly . Razumihin somehow discovered and proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting him for six months , and when this student died , leaving a decrepit old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year , Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral when he died . Raskolnikov's landlady bore witness , too , that when they had lived in another house at Five Corners , Raskolnikov had rescued two little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so . This was investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses . These facts made an impression in his favour . And in the end the criminal was , in consideration of extenuating circumstances , condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight years only . At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov's mother fell ill . Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the trial . Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg , so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible . Pulcheria Alexandrovna's illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial derangement of her intellect . When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother , she had found her mother already ill , in feverish delirium . That evening Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother's questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her mother's benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia on a business commission , which would bring him in the end money and reputation . But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never asked them anything on the subject , neither then nor thereafter . On the contrary , she had her own version of her son's sudden departure ; she told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her , hinting that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts , and that Rodya had many very powerful enemies , so that it was necessary for him to be in hiding . As for his future career , she had no doubt that it would be brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed . She assured Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman , that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it . This article she was continually reading , she even read it aloud , almost took it to bed with her , but scarcely asked where Rodya was , though the subject was obviously avoided by the others , which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions . They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna's strange silence on certain subjects . She did not , for instance , complain of getting no letters from him , though in previous years she had only lived on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya . This was the cause of great uneasiness to Dounia ; the idea occurred to her that her mother suspected that there was something terrible in her son's fate and was afraid to ask , for fear of hearing something still more awful . In any case , Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of her faculties . It happened once or twice , however , that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her without mentioning where Rodya was , and on receiving unsatisfactory and suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent , and this mood lasted for a long time . Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely silent on certain points ; but it became more and more evident that the poor mother suspected something terrible . Dounia remembered her brother 's telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the fatal day of the confession : had not she made out something from that ? Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be succeeded by a period of hysterical animation , and the invalid would begin to talk almost incessantly of her son , of her hopes of his future .... Her fancies were sometimes very strange . They humoured her , pretended to agree with her ( she saw perhaps that they were pretending ) , but she still went on talking . Five months after Raskolnikov's confession , he was sentenced . Razumihin and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible . At last the moment of separation came . Dounia swore to her brother that the separation should not be for ever , Razumihin did the same . Razumihin , in his youthful ardour , had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years , and saving up a certain sum , to emigrate to Siberia , a country rich in every natural resource and in need of workers , active men and capital . There they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would begin a new life . They all wept at parting . Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before . He asked a great deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her . He worried so much about her that it alarmed Dounia . When he heard about his mother's illness he became very gloomy . With Sonia he was particularly reserved all the time . With the help of the money left to her by Svidrigaïlov , Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia . Not a word passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject , but both knew it would be so . At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his sister's and Razumihin's fervent anticipations of their happy future together when he should come out of prison . He predicted that their mother's illness would soon have a fatal ending . Sonia and he at last set off . Two months later Dounia was married to Razumihin . It was a quiet and sorrowful wedding ; Porfiry Petrovitch and Zossimov were invited however . During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination . Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she could not but believe in him . He displayed a rare strength of will . Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order to take his degree . They were continually making plans for the future ; both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least . Till then they rested their hopes on Sonia . Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia's marriage with Razumihin ; but after the marriage she became even more melancholy and anxious . To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two little children from a fire . These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria Alexandrovna's disordered imagination almost to ecstasy . She was continually talking about them , even entering into conversation with strangers in the street , though Dounia always accompanied her . In public conveyances and shops , wherever she could capture a listener , she would begin the discourse about her son , his article , how he had helped the student , how he had been burnt at the fire , and so on ! Dounia did not know how to restrain her . Apart from the danger of her morbid excitement , there was the risk of someone 's recalling Raskolnikov's name and speaking of the recent trial . Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted on going to see her . At last her restlessness reached an extreme point . She would sometimes begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious . One morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home , that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must expect him back in nine months . She began to prepare for his coming , began to do up her room for him , to clean the furniture , to wash and put up new hangings and so on . Dounia was anxious , but said nothing and helped her to arrange the room . After a fatiguing day spent in continual fancies , in joyful day-dreams and tears , Pulcheria Alexandrovna was taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious . It was brain fever . She died within a fortnight . In her delirium she dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her son's terrible fate than they had supposed . For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother's death , though a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached Siberia . It was carried on by means of Sonia , who wrote every month to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity . At first they found Sonia's letters dry and unsatisfactory , but later on they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better , for from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate brother's life . Sonia's letters were full of the most matter-of-fact detail , the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov's surroundings as a convict . There was no word of her own hopes , no conjecture as to the future , no description of her feelings . Instead of any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life , she gave the simple facts--that is , his own words , an exact account of his health , what he asked for at their interviews , what commission he gave her and so on . All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness . The picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness and precision . There could be no mistake , because nothing was given but facts . But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news , especially at first . Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not ready to talk , that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave him from their letters , that he sometimes asked after his mother and that when , seeing that he had guessed the truth , she told him at last of her death , she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly affected by it , not externally at any rate . She told them that , although he seemed so wrapped up in himself and , as it were , shut himself off from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life ; that he understood his position , expected nothing better for the time , had no ill-founded hopes ( as is so common in his position ) and scarcely seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings , so unlike anything he had known before . She wrote that his health was satisfactory ; he did his work without shirking or seeking to do more ; he was almost indifferent about food , but except on Sundays and holidays the food was so bad that at last he had been glad to accept some money from her , Sonia , to have his own tea every day . He begged her not to trouble about anything else , declaring that all this fuss about him only annoyed him . Sonia wrote further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest , that she had not seen the inside of their barracks , but concluded that they were crowded , miserable and unhealthy ; that he slept on a plank bed with a rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement . But that he lived so poorly and roughly , not from any plan or design , but simply from inattention and indifference . Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits , had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming , unwilling to talk and rude to her . But that in the end these visits had become a habit and almost a necessity for him , so that he was positively distressed when she was ill for some days and could not visit him . She used to see him on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room , to which he was brought for a few minutes to see her . On working days she would go to see him at work either at the workshops or at the brick kilns , or at the sheds on the banks of the Irtish . About herself , Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some acquaintances in the town , that she did sewing , and , as there was scarcely a dressmaker in the town , she was looked upon as an indispensable person in many houses . But she did not mention that the authorities were , through her , interested in Raskolnikov ; that his task was lightened and so on . At last the news came ( Dounia had indeed noticed signs of alarm and uneasiness in the preceding letters ) that he held aloof from everyone , that his fellow prisoners did not like him , that he kept silent for days at a time and was becoming very pale . In the last letter Sonia wrote that he had been taken very seriously ill and was in the convict ward of the hospital . II He was ill a long time . But it was not the horrors of prison life , not the hard labour , the bad food , the shaven head , or the patched clothes that crushed him . What did he care for all those trials and hardships ! he was even glad of the hard work . Physically exhausted , he could at least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep . And what was the food to him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it ? In the past as a student he had often not had even that . His clothes were warm and suited to his manner of life . He did not even feel the fetters . Was he ashamed of his shaven head and parti-coloured coat ? Before whom ? Before Sonia ? Sonia was afraid of him , how could he be ashamed before her ? And yet he was ashamed even before Sonia , whom he tortured because of it with his contemptuous rough manner . But it was not his shaven head and his fetters he was ashamed of : his pride had been stung to the quick . It was wounded pride that made him ill . Oh , how happy he would have been if he could have blamed himself ! He could have borne anything then , even shame and disgrace . But he judged himself severely , and his exasperated conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past , except a simple blunder which might happen to anyone . He was ashamed just because he , Raskolnikov , had so hopelessly , stupidly come to grief through some decree of blind fate , and must humble himself and submit to "" the idiocy "" of a sentence , if he were anyhow to be at peace . Vague and objectless anxiety in the present , and in the future a continual sacrifice leading to nothing--that was all that lay before him . And what comfort was it to him that at the end of eight years he would only be thirty-two and able to begin a new life ! What had he to live for ? What had he to look forward to ? Why should he strive ? To live in order to exist ? Why , he had been ready a thousand times before to give up existence for the sake of an idea , for a hope , even for a fancy . Mere existence had always been too little for him ; he had always wanted more . Perhaps it was just because of the strength of his desires that he had thought himself a man to whom more was permissible than to others . And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that would have torn his heart and robbed him of sleep , that repentance , the awful agony of which brings visions of hanging or drowning ! Oh , he would have been glad of it ! Tears and agonies would at least have been life . But he did not repent of his crime . At least he might have found relief in raging at his stupidity , as he had raged at the grotesque blunders that had brought him to prison . But now in prison , in freedom , he thought over and criticised all his actions again and by no means found them so blundering and so grotesque as they had seemed at the fatal time . "" In what way , "" he asked himself , "" was my theory stupider than others that have swarmed and clashed from the beginning of the world ? One has only to look at the thing quite independently , broadly , and uninfluenced by commonplace ideas , and my idea will by no means seem so ... strange . Oh , sceptics and halfpenny philosophers , why do you halt half-way ! "" "" Why does my action strike them as so horrible ? "" he said to himself . "" Is it because it was a crime ? What is meant by crime ? My conscience is at rest . Of course , it was a legal crime , of course , the letter of the law was broken and blood was shed . Well , punish me for the letter of the law ... and that 's enough . Of course , in that case many of the benefactors of mankind who snatched power for themselves instead of inheriting it ought to have been punished at their first steps . But those men succeeded and so they were right , and I did n't , and so I had no right to have taken that step . "" It was only in that that he recognised his criminality , only in the fact that he had been unsuccessful and had confessed it . He suffered too from the question : why had he not killed himself ? Why had he stood looking at the river and preferred to confess ? Was the desire to live so strong and was it so hard to overcome it ? Had not Svidrigaïlov overcome it , although he was afraid of death ? In misery he asked himself this question , and could not understand that , at the very time he had been standing looking into the river , he had perhaps been dimly conscious of the fundamental falsity in himself and his convictions . He did n't understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis , of a new view of life and of his future resurrection . He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he could not step over , again through weakness and meanness . He looked at his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and prized it . It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in prison than in freedom . What terrible agonies and privations some of them , the tramps for instance , had endured ! Could they care so much for a ray of sunshine , for the primeval forest , the cold spring hidden away in some unseen spot , which the tramp had marked three years before , and longed to see again , as he might to see his sweetheart , dreaming of the green grass round it and the bird singing in the bush ? As he went on he saw still more inexplicable examples . In prison , of course , there was a great deal he did not see and did not want to see ; he lived as it were with downcast eyes . It was loathsome and unbearable for him to look . But in the end there was much that surprised him and he began , as it were involuntarily , to notice much that he had not suspected before . What surprised him most of all was the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest . They seemed to be a different species , and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility . He felt and knew the reasons of his isolation , but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong . There were some Polish exiles , political prisoners , among them . They simply looked down upon all the rest as ignorant churls ; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that . He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the Poles . There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous , a former officer and two seminarists . Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly . He was disliked and avoided by everyone ; they even began to hate him at last--why , he could not tell . Men who had been far more guilty despised and laughed at his crime . "" You 're a gentleman , "" they used to say . "" You should n ' t hack about with an axe ; that 's not a gentleman's work . "" The second week in Lent , his turn came to take the sacrament with his gang . He went to church and prayed with the others . A quarrel broke out one day , he did not know how . All fell on him at once in a fury . "" You 're an infidel ! You do n't believe in God , "" they shouted . "" You ought to be killed . "" He had never talked to them about God nor his belief , but they wanted to kill him as an infidel . He said nothing . One of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy . Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently ; his eyebrows did not quiver , his face did not flinch . The guard succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant , or there would have been bloodshed . There was another question he could not decide : why were they all so fond of Sonia ? She did not try to win their favour ; she rarely met them , sometimes only she came to see him at work for a moment . And yet everybody knew her , they knew that she had come out to follow him , knew how and where she lived . She never gave them money , did them no particular services . Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents of pies and rolls . But by degrees closer relations sprang up between them and Sonia . She would write and post letters for them to their relations . Relations of the prisoners who visited the town , at their instructions , left with Sonia presents and money for them . Their wives and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her . And when she visited Raskolnikov at work , or met a party of the prisoners on the road , they all took off their hats to her . "" Little mother Sofya Semyonovna , you are our dear , good little mother , "" coarse branded criminals said to that frail little creature . She would smile and bow to them and everyone was delighted when she smiled . They even admired her gait and turned round to watch her walking ; they admired her too for being so little , and , in fact , did not know what to admire her most for . They even came to her for help in their illnesses . He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter . When he was better , he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish and delirious . He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of Asia . All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen . Some new sorts of microbes were attacking the bodies of men , but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will . Men attacked by them became at once mad and furious . But never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers , never had they considered their decisions , their scientific conclusions , their moral convictions so infallible . Whole villages , whole towns and peoples went mad from the infection . All were excited and did not understand one another . Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched looking at the others , beat himself on the breast , wept , and wrung his hands . They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good ; they did not know whom to blame , whom to justify . Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite . They gathered together in armies against one another , but even on the march the armies would begin attacking each other , the ranks would be broken and the soldiers would fall on each other , stabbing and cutting , biting and devouring each other . The alarm bell was ringing all day long in the towns ; men rushed together , but why they were summoned and who was summoning them no one knew . The most ordinary trades were abandoned , because everyone proposed his own ideas , his own improvements , and they could not agree . The land too was abandoned . Men met in groups , agreed on something , swore to keep together , but at once began on something quite different from what they had proposed . They accused one another , fought and killed each other . There were conflagrations and famine . All men and all things were involved in destruction . The plague spread and moved further and further . Only a few men could be saved in the whole world . They were a pure chosen people , destined to found a new race and a new life , to renew and purify the earth , but no one had seen these men , no one had heard their words and their voices . Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so miserably , the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long . The second week after Easter had come . There were warm bright spring days ; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel paced were opened . Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during his illness ; each time she had to obtain permission , and it was difficult . But she often used to come to the hospital yard , especially in the evening , sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the windows of the ward . One evening , when he was almost well again , Raskolnikov fell asleep . On waking up he chanced to go to the window , and at once saw Sonia in the distance at the hospital gate . She seemed to be waiting for someone . Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute . He shuddered and moved away from the window . Next day Sonia did not come , nor the day after ; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily . At last he was discharged . On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out . He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her ; he soon learnt that her illness was not dangerous . Hearing that he was anxious about her , Sonia sent him a pencilled note , telling him that she was much better , that she had a slight cold and that she would soon , very soon come and see him at his work . His heart throbbed painfully as he read it . Again it was a warm bright day . Early in the morning , at six o ' clock , he went off to work on the river bank , where they used to pound alabaster and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed . There were only three of them sent . One of the convicts went with the guard to the fortress to fetch a tool ; the other began getting the wood ready and laying it in the kiln . Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river bank , sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the wide deserted river . From the high bank a broad landscape opened before him , the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank . In the vast steppe , bathed in sunshine , he could just see , like black specks , the nomads' tents . There there was freedom , there other men were living , utterly unlike those here ; there time itself seemed to stand still , as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed . Raskolnikov sat gazing , his thoughts passed into day-dreams , into contemplation ; he thought of nothing , but a vague restlessness excited and troubled him . Suddenly he found Sonia beside him ; she had come up noiselessly and sat down at his side . It was still quite early ; the morning chill was still keen . She wore her poor old burnous and the green shawl ; her face still showed signs of illness , it was thinner and paler . She gave him a joyful smile of welcome , but held out her hand with her usual timidity . She was always timid of holding out her hand to him and sometimes did not offer it at all , as though afraid he would repel it . He always took her hand as though with repugnance , always seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout her visit . Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply grieved . But now their hands did not part . He stole a rapid glance at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking . They were alone , no one had seen them . The guard had turned away for the time . How it happened he did not know . But all at once something seemed to seize him and fling him at her feet . He wept and threw his arms round her knees . For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she turned pale . She jumped up and looked at him trembling . But at the same moment she understood , and a light of infinite happiness came into her eyes . She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and that at last the moment had come .... They wanted to speak , but could not ; tears stood in their eyes . They were both pale and thin ; but those sick pale faces were bright with the dawn of a new future , of a full resurrection into a new life . They were renewed by love ; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the heart of the other . They resolved to wait and be patient . They had another seven years to wait , and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before them ! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his being , while she--she only lived in his life . On the evening of the same day , when the barracks were locked , Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her . He had even fancied that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him differently ; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered him in a friendly way . He remembered that now , and thought it was bound to be so . Was n ' t everything now bound to be changed ? He thought of her . He remembered how continually he had tormented her and wounded her heart . He remembered her pale and thin little face . But these recollections scarcely troubled him now ; he knew with what infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings . And what were all , all the agonies of the past ! Everything , even his crime , his sentence and imprisonment , seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an external , strange fact with which he had no concern . But he could not think for long together of anything that evening , and he could not have analysed anything consciously ; he was simply feeling . Life had stepped into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself out in his mind . Under his pillow lay the New Testament . He took it up mechanically . The book belonged to Sonia ; it was the one from which she had read the raising of Lazarus to him . At first he was afraid that she would worry him about religion , would talk about the gospel and pester him with books . But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject and had not even offered him the Testament . He had asked her for it himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without a word . Till now he had not opened it . He did not open it now , but one thought passed through his mind : "" Can her convictions not be mine now ? Her feelings , her aspirations at least .... "" She too had been greatly agitated that day , and at night she was taken ill again . But she was so happy--and so unexpectedly happy--that she was almost frightened of her happiness . Seven years , only seven years ! At the beginning of their happiness at some moments they were both ready to look on those seven years as though they were seven days . He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing , that he would have to pay dearly for it , that it would cost him great striving , great suffering . But that is the beginning of a new story--the story of the gradual renewal of a man , the story of his gradual regeneration , of his passing from one world into another , of his initiation into a new unknown life . That might be the subject of a new story , but our present story is ended .",8,8
"Changing Fonts and Font sizes in Microsoft Word A font is a style and design of text. Examine this letter: Now examine this one: As you can see, the two style are completely different. Notice how straight and blocky the second one is compared to the first. The first one has little pointy bits on its edges. The pointy bit is called a serif. Fonts are basically split into two types - those that have the pointy edges, and those that don't. The pointy fonts are called serif fonts, and the ones without pointy bits are called sans serif fonts. The first of the letter e's is the very popular serif font ""Times New Roman"". The second letter e is the most popular sans serif font ""Arial"". With Microsoft Word, the font you get if you don't make any changes is Times New Roman. That's because Times is an excellent font to use for your body text. The complementary sans serif font Arial goes well as a heading when Times is used for the body text. Newspapers use this combination a lot - Arial for the heading, Times for the text. We'll do the same. We'll use Arial for the heading of our report, because the body text is all in Times New Roman. To change the font heading to Arial, do the following: Highlight the heading ?Constable Tucker?s Crime Statistics? While the text is highlighted, get rid of the underline by clicking the U icon in the toolbar (The underline looks awful!) Click on Format from the menu bar Click the word Font The following dialogue box appears: There are three main areas to concentrate on: Font, Font style, and Size. The Font that is highlighted is Times New Roman. This is because it is the font we are currently using. For the same reason, the regular Font style is highlighted and Size 14. We want to change the Font from Times to Arial. Scroll up by clicking the little black arrow in the Font text box Arial will be right at the top. When you get there, click on Arial with your left mouse button to select it. We have now set the Font we want. To set the style, click on bold in the next text box along. Change the size by scrolling down and clicking on 16. Your font dialogue box should now look like this: Before you click the OK button, notice the ""Font color"" area. As it's name implies, you can set a colour for your Font. To do that, click the black down-pointing arrow just to the right of ""Automatic"". You'll get the colour box. Click on a colour that takes your fancy. You'll see what it looks like in the Preview box at the bottom. We won't worry at this stage about the Effects part of the dialogue box. So just click OK when you're finished. While the text is highlighted, click the centre align icon to centre your headings. Your heading should now look like this: There is another way you can set the font, without opening the font dialogue box. You have probably noticed this in your toolbar: This is a shortcut to changing your Font and Font size. Don't worry about the first box ""Normal"" for now. If you click the black down-pointing arrow, just to the right of ""Times New Roman"", you'll get a drop down list of fonts: The Fonts available to you will probably be different to the ones above. To select one, just move your mouse down and click with your left hand mouse button. Click the black arrows to scroll down and see more fonts that you can choose. The font size box works in a similar way - click the black down arrow and you get a list of font sizes. Click on one to choose it. Now that you can change the font, is there anything else we can do to Constable Tucker's report? ",2,2

Whereas by section 104 of the M6 Companies ( Consolidation ) Act 1908 it was provided that , upon the re-issue of redeemed debentures , the person entitled to the debentures should have the same rights and priorities as if the debentures had not previously been issued : And whereas section 49 of the M7 Companies Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1930 amended section 104 of the Act of 1908 so as to provide ( among other things ) that the said person should have the same priorities as if the debentures had never been redeemed , but saved , in the case of debentures redeemed before , but re-issued after , 1st January 1933 , the rights and priorities of persons under mortgages and charges created before that date : Now , therefore , where any debentures which were redeemed before the date last mentioned have been re-issued after that date and before the commencement of the Act of 1960 ( 1st April 1961 ) , or are or have been re-issued after that commencement , the re-issue of the debentures does not prejudice , and is deemed never to have prejudiced , any right or priority which any person would have had under or by virtue of any such mortgage or charge as above referred to if section 104 of the Act of 1908 , as originally enacted , had been enacted in the Act of 1960 instead of section 89 of that Act , and in the principal Order instead of Article 203 of that Order .

( 3 ) Where in any provision of the Orders there is a reference to another provision of those Orders , and the first-mentioned provision operates , or is capable of operating , in relation to things done or omitted , or events occurring or not occurring , in the past ( including in particular past acts of compliance with any statutory provision , failures of compliance , contraventions , offences and convictions of offences ) , the reference to that other provision is to be read as including a reference to the corresponding provision of the Acts . ( 4 ) A contravention of any provision of the Acts committed before the commencement date shall not be visited with any more severe punishment under or by virtue of the Orders than would have been applicable under that provision at the time of the contravention ; but -- ( a ) where an offence for the continuance of which a penalty was provided has been committed under any provision of the Acts , proceedings may be taken under the Orders in respect of the continuance of the offence after the commencement date in the like manner as if the offence had been committed under the corresponding provision of the Orders ; and ( b ) the repeal of any transitory provision of the Acts ( not replaced by any corresponding provision of the Orders ) requiring a thing to be done within a certain time does not affect a person's continued liability to be prosecuted and punished in respect of the failure , or continued failure , to do that thing . ( 5 ) The generality of section 29 ( 3 ) ( b ) of the M11 Interpretation Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1954 is not affected by any specific conversion of references made by this Order , nor by the inclusion in any provision of the Orders of a reference ( whether express or implied , and in whatever phraseology ) to the provision of the Acts corresponding to that provision , or to a provision of the Acts which is replaced by a corresponding provision of the Orders . ( 6 ) Nothing in the Orders affects -- ( a ) the registration or re-registration of any company under the former Companies Acts , or the continued existence of any company by virtue of such registration or re-registration ; or ( b ) the application of -- ( i ) Table B in the M12 Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 , or ( ii ) Table A in the M13 Companies Act 1862 , the M14 Companies ( Consolidation ) Act 1908 , the M15 Companies Act ( Northern Ireland ) 1932 or the Act of 1960 , to any company existing immediately before the commencement date ; or ( c ) the operation of any statutory provision providing for any partnership , association or company being wound up , or being wound up as a company or as an unregistered company under any of the former Companies Acts .

"January 13, 2012 It probably would have been cheaper.. It probably would have been cheaper to buy a little dress at Target but then I wouldn't have had the pleasure of making it. The fabric was from back in the days when I was working as a buyer for dress fabric in a Department Store, 1980's, light poly-cotton.  Great for washing, drying in the dryer and no need to iron.  I added a 3"" hem so it can be let down as she grows. Measurement No 2, In this case 5 1/2 "" deep across the width of the fabric (selvedge to selvedge 45"" ) fabric 2   (flower print) Measurement No 3  less measurement 2 , in this case 12"",  across the fabric to match fabric 1. 4 pieces 15"" x 2"" for straps Construction - straps Sew straps so that they have a finished size of about 3/4"". There are lots of different ways you can do this, so quick some slow. I like to sew the slow way. I sew  together the edges on the wrong side and then turn through. Iron flat with the seam now placed in the middle of the strap. I push a small amount of fabric back into the strap at one end and then sew close to the edge all the way around.  Put aside to attach later. Construction - Body Sew two pieces of fabric together across the width, neaten edge and top stitch the seam.  Over-lock or neaten around the whole piece. Turn over small hem at top edge and sew down with a straight stitch. Using tailors chalk or some other removable marker, Mark 7 lines across fabric  at equal distances from each other as a guide for attaching the shirring elastic, (see note at end). After shirring the width should be about your chest at armpit measurement.  (Make sure you remove the marked lines at this point.) Sew the edges together matching the elastic ends.  I then sew this seam flat so it doesn't irritate the wearer. Turn up your bottom hem at a measurement equal to the length from armpit to mid knee.  I added a wide hem so that it could be let down. Attaching the straps The join in the fabric now sits at centre back Measure in 1 1/2"" from the side and attach the front straps to the top hem.  I turn my ends under and sew around the edge to do this. Place your back straps to sit just inside your front staps and attach. With all those words you can see why it took so long.  I'm sure I would have been quicker if I hadn't been in this wheelchair. Now I need to make a little flower to go onto a hair-clip to finish it off. Note about shirring Nearly every sewing machine manufacturer has a different recommended method of doing this.  Some wind the elastic onto the bobbin, some have a special foot attachment.  In some classrooms I would have 4 or 5 different machine brands and some of them were so old that shirring elastic hadn't been invented, so I devised this method for old machines and no attachments. Set you machine to zig zag at about 2.5 length and 1.8 width.  The needle should swing just either side of the elastic. Tie a knot at the starting end and zig zag into position using your marked line as a guide.  Leave a tail of about 5"".  Do this for each line. DO NOT GATHER AS YOU SEW. Make sure the beginning of each piece of elastic is secure by sewing a line of straight stitch down the edge. Pull up your elastic like gathering thread to the size required and secure the ends. If you pull the fabric top and bottom you will find that the elastic will align itself. Of course if you have a machine that does shirring just use the recommended method. ",2,2
"Part Five : A Soul Not Lost She lay there with her eyes closed , lifeless , but she was n't dead . She woke up and breathed , she was at the bottom of the sea and she could breathe . She looked and saw a bright beautiful locket , she picked it up and held it in her hand ... it glowed a seducing light and it was like no one could resist its beauty . There was some thing familiar about this strange glow , then it hit her , this was her locket she lost when she came here all those years ago , she remembered she was lying on top of the ocean and her locket dropped from her hand ... she tried to get it , but she was too weak . This was a locket formed from magic of the great light her grandmother spoke of . She put it on and felt a strange feeling in her heart . She sat there on the bottom looking around and she began to see what was behind the darkness , the light granted her the gift of seeing beyond the dark . She saw bright blue sea above her and many many fish ... she saw things we 've only dreamed of seeing . Until she saw a door ... that strange door from her mysterious dream , "" No , no this ca n't be ! "" She had that piercing feeling in her heart again and fell to the floor . She put her hand over her heart and lay down . Things began to blacken in her eyes and she saw darkness . She rolled over to face the top of the ocean and she fell into darkness . She saw herself floating in darkness with nothing a sound , but a soft echo of the water running . She saw Sora reaching his hand out to her , but she could not grab it . she saw herself as a young girl floating in the ocean and she heard voices , "" What took you so long princess ? A world without you , what is the source of the heartless ? Darkness . We must find him . Where 's Sora ? Drifting in a lonely world without a soul . Sora , where 's Sora ? We 'll go together !

She put on the necklace and left them to go to the paopu tree . She got to the tree and sat there thinking of Sora . She had a new power around her neck and now she was able to use it to find Sora .",8,8
"By delving into what these quirky artists were doing, you discover what was going on in politics and culture at the time, Marotti said. Duke University Press is gearing up to publish the book as New York's Museum of Modern Art mounts a major retrospective devoted to the art movement. ""Tokyo 1955 -- 1970: A New Avant-Garde,"" which runs through Feb. 25 at MoMA, showcases more than 200 pieces from the era, 20 of which figure in Marotti's book. An associate professor of history at UCLA and an affiliated scholar with the university's Terasaki Center for Japanese Studies, Marotti is a leading authority on Japan's postwar avant-garde. ""Money, Trains, and Guillotines"" is the product of two decades worth of investigation of the movement and its key figures, who are little known in the West, with the exception of the transnational artist Yoko Ono. For the book, Marotti interviewed more than 40 prominent players and mined multiple archives and dozens of private collections in the U.S. and Japan. In the book, he credits the movement with ""the unearthing of hidden connections to politics and history in the simplest objects of daily life"" and ""the identification of the world of the everyday itself as the central space for investigation and transformation."" Taking aim at what was then a newly expanding consumer society, their results were so controversial that they often attracted the attention of the police. ""In a certain sense, agents of the state became some of this art's most enthusiastic appreciators,"" Marotti said. Authorities ""identified the nascent political potential within it."" Artists who figure prominently in the book include: Akasegawa Genpei (1937 -- ) Akasegawa's monochrome works on paper depicting 1,000-yen notes started attracting the attention of law enforcement and a wider public in 1963. Eventually, he was convicted on obscure obscenity laws, and his conviction was upheld by Japan's Supreme Court. Although Akasegawa never served jail time, the case, which dragged on for seven years, became a cause clbre and ended up exposing the limits on artistic freedom and freedom of speech embedded in the Japanese constitution that Allied forces left in place after the occupation, Marotti argues. Today Akasegawa is a popular author in Japan. Nakanishi Natsuyuki (1935 -- ) Nakanishi started attracting attention in 1962 with his ""Compact Object"" series, which embedded bones, clock parts, watches, eggshells, eyeglass lenses and other delicate objects in polyester egg shapes. He is now a world-famous artist. Imaizumi Yoshihiko (1931 -- 2010) Imaizumi, together with Nakanishi, conceived a plan for a guerrilla art installation of a giant glass guillotine in the Imperial Plaza outside the emperor's palace in Tokyo. The work, ""Equipment Plan,"" referenced a controversial 1960 short story in which Japan's emperor and his family are beheaded, which at the time of publication had triggered rightist violence and repression; it also referenced the artist's frustration with the lack of accountability for Emperor Hirohito's role in World War II and the crushing of popular protests often centered in the Imperial Plaza itself. ""Equipment Plan"" ended up being abandoned due to funding and logistical issues, but the unrealized work became a touchstone for a new political practice of art. Imaizumi subsequently helped found the radical Bigakko art academy, teaching there until his death in 2010. Takamatsu Jir ? (1936 -- 98) Takamatsu, along with Nakanishi, attracted attention in 1962 by staging ""happenings"" on Tokyo's central Yamanote train line. Wearing everyday clothing, the artists unsettled commuters by applying white face paint and improvising performances on the trains and stations with ""Compact Object"" and other art pieces that incorporated everyday objects. Prior to his death in 1998, Takamatsu had achieved substantial international acclaim as an artist. Kazakura Sh ? (1936 -- 2007) Kazakura's extraordinary performance-art experiments included sirens, nude ""happenings"" and voluntary branding with a hot iron. Along with Akasegawa and Takamatsu, he attracted attention in 1964 with a series of ""happenings"" in which they threw everyday objects  -- such as an umbrella, a satchel, a suitcase full of clothes and a bed sheet  -- off the roofs of tall buildings. Kazakura today is recognized as a pioneering performance artist. Shinohara Ushio (1932 -- ) Shinohara, a member of Japan's neo-Dada group, began attracting attention in 1960 with a series of performed ""paintings"" created by smacking canvases with boxing gloves dipped in ink. Distinctive for his Mohawk-style haircut and hugely energetic and colorful canvases and sculptures, the now -- Brooklyn-based Shinohara went on to international acclaim and is currently enjoying a particularly strong resurgence in popularity. These and other Japanese artists rose to prominence in the calm after a politically stormy period in which Japan's progressive elements rose up in protest against the U.S. -- Japan Mutual Security Treaty, Marotti found. Ultimately signed into law in 1960, the revised treaty formalized Japan's role as a key Cold War ally of the U.S. and partner during the Vietnam War. In an attempt to co-opt opposition to the treaty and stifle activism on the part of labor, Japan's new prime minister, Hayato Ikeda, promised to double Japanese citizens' incomes in a decade, making the state the guarantor of consumer comforts. The high-growth era entailed marked lifestyle shifts and necessitated long commutes for a growing number of Japanese in dense apartment blocks concentrated on the expanding periphery of Tokyo and other urban centers. Meanwhile, the government was going out of its way to project a rehabilitated image of itself. This drive, Marotti writes, ""became increasingly oppressive as the [1964 Tokyo] Olympics drew near, the event that was to symbolize Japan's triumphant emergence from under the clouds of wartime and reconstruction, standing on its own as a showcase of U.S.-sponsored modernization."" Abandoning the social realist style that had previously typified Japan's progressive artists, this avant-garde forged a new vocabulary to challenge what they saw as their country's newfound compliancy. Through pieces incorporating found objects, such as ""Compact Object,"" the artists prodded fellow citizens to question the wave of consumer culture overtaking the country, Marotti contends. The happenings and other interventions, meanwhile, were designed to expose what the author calls ""hidden forms of domination in the everyday world,"" taking art into the streets and trains to intercept Tokyo residents during their long commutes with the purpose of ""agitating"" the suddenly quiescent citizenry. In one Olympics-related happening described in the book, avant-garde artists donned white lab coats and surgical masks and got down on their hands and knees to scrub sidewalks in Tokyo's tony Ginza district -- an effort receiving praise from the tone-deaf authorities, Marotti recounts. The Fluxus group would later repeat this action in New York City. Meanwhile, with single-sided monochrome prints of the 1,000-yen note, which were decorated with the image of an imperial prince, and the unrealized guillotine escapade, the artists were perpetrating what Marotti describes as a ""symbolic attack"" on the postwar constitution's continued elevation of the emperor as a symbol of authority. Their oppositional activity emerged from and engaged a long history of art and political protest hearkening back to the postwar occupation period. Marotti credits an annual art show sponsored by a prominent newspaper, the Yomiuri Shinbun, with having galvanized the avant-garde at the time. That is, until the exhibition was abruptly suspended in 1964 because, in the words of detractors, ""it was disturbing public order."" The artists were also stimulated by such American neo-Dadaists as Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, who eschewed traditional concepts of aesthetics and whose work was exemplified by the use of modern materials, popular imagery and absurdist contrasts. But in many ways, Marotti concludes, the Japanese artists were ahead of their times, with a critical focus and organizational strategies that anticipated guerrilla art, wrapped art and Pop Art -- and moreover, the key political concerns of the late 1960s. ""While working independently, these artists were very much 'of the moment,'"" he said. ""They grasped this explosive moment in consumer culture and analyzed its political effects."" ",5,1

"Whenever a certain song, band, album, sound or genre breaks through into mainstream consciousness, the early adopters are going to feel ripped off and jaded.  Bill Brewster of The Guardian writes about the decline of UK club culture in the face of EDM's rapid ascent. Back in the mid-90s, an act from the record label I ran at the time was selected to appear on Top of the Pops. But when we went to meet the American duo at Heathrow, neither of them got off the plane: they had decided to stay at home. Eventually, we hired two actors to play the role of DJ and keyboard player. They looked the part and no one seemed to notice. I was reminded of this episode yesterday when reading that DJ Calvin Harris has threatened legal action against the BBC for quoting him in a Radio 1 Newsbeat programme in which he appears to endorse prerecorded DJ sets. Like wrestling in the 1970s, there's always been an element of knowing subterfuge in dance music. Since much of the alchemy of the 12-inch mix is often down to one person and a bunch of machines, it does not always translate well to live performance. The real magic is when a skilled DJ and a box of records -- or laptop or memory stick, as it increasingly is today -- take those solitary studio moments and turn them into something communal and occasionally transcendental, with the assistance of a packed dancefloor.

Rating summary Seems to be a good system I recently bought a house with one of these already installed. The unit has been running for 8 + years and still going strong. From my limited exposure to this type of hot water system I think it works quite well and much cheaper than my old straight electric one. I would rate it as a 3 and a half star performer.....but it is a bit worrying that the company has gone bust. Worked better for our household (3 adults and 1 kid) when taken off just the cheapest off peak electricity option.....and not much more costly to run either. ,5,0
"First session New York , 8-19 April 2002 Implementation of article VI and paragraph 4 ( c ) of the 1995 Decision on "" Principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament "" Report submitted by Sweden As stated in the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , in the section entitled "" Article VI and eighth to twelfth preambular paragraphs "" , in paragraph 15 , subparagraph 12 , the Conference agreed on : "" Regular reports , within the framework of the strengthened review process for the Non-Proliferation Treaty , by all States parties on the implementation of article VI and paragraph 4 ( c ) of the 1995 Decision on ' Principles and Objectives for Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament ' "" . Sweden would hereby like to submit its report to the first session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . Nuclear disarmament The 2000 NPT Review Conference During the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , Sweden participated in the New Agenda Coalition , which played a role in the final negotiations with the nuclear-weapon States to secure a successful outcome of the Conference . The group had prepared extensively for the Review Conference and had a common position as basis for negotiations . Sweden , as a member of the European Union ( EU ) , also participated in developing a common EU position for the Review Conference . The Union delivered a statement on the basis of the joint position at the Conference . Since the 2000 Review Conference , the New Agenda Coalition has engaged in a constructive dialogue with the nuclear-weapon States on their implementation of the 13 steps agreed to at the Conference on how to achieve nuclear disarmament . In November 2000 , the work of the 2000 Review Conference was followed up at the fifty-fifth session of the United Nations General Assembly . The New Agenda , coordinated by Sweden , presented a draft resolution ( A / C. 1 / 55 / L. 4 and Rev. 1 , subsequently adopted as resolution 55 / 33C ) , which reaffirmed the results of the Conference . It received very strong support by Member States and was adopted on 20 November 2000 with only three countries voting against ( India , Pakistan and Israel ) and eight countries abstaining . During the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly , Sweden voted in favour of resolution 55 / 41 , entitled "" Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty "" , which called for necessary measures to enable the Treaty to enter into force . During spring 2001 , Sweden held the Presidency of the European Union and delivered a statement on behalf of the Union in the Conference on Disarmament calling , inter alia , for the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the commencement of work in the Conference on Disarmament . Sweden strived to advance the European Union work in the spring session of the United Nations Disarmament Commission on the nuclear topic "" Ways and means to achieve nuclear disarmament "" . In October 2001 , the New Agenda decided not to present a resolution in the First Committee of the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly . The New Agenda Ministers for Foreign Affairs expressed their views in a Ministerial Communiqué presented on 8 October 2001 in the Committee by the coordinator of the Group , South Africa . 1 The Ministers agreed that the priority would be to pursue their initiative in the context of the forthcoming Non-Proliferation Treaty review process beginning in 2002 . "" The 2000 NPT undertakings on nuclear disarmament had been given . Implementation of them was now the imperative . "" In November 2001 , the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs , Ms. Anna Lindh , participated in the Conference on Facilitating the Entry into Force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty . Ms. Lindh held a national statement in the plenary , which dealt with nuclear disarmament in general and with the Treaty in particular . In the margins of the conference , Sweden , together with Canada and Australia , financed a seminar , organized by the United Kingdom-based NGO VERTIC , to promote the verification system of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization ( CTBTO ) in Vienna . Foreign Minister Lindh made an introductory statement , expressing strong support for CTBTO and its capacity to verify the Treaty . Furthermore , Ms. Lindh also gave a speech in the General Assembly in November 2001.2 A significant section of the Swedish speech was devoted to nuclear disarmament . In November 2001 , the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs , in a press statement , welcomed the announcements by the United States of America and the Russian Federation concerning planned reductions in their strategic nuclear weapons arsenals . She also expressed hope that the reductions would be irreversible , transparent and verifiable . In December 2001 , Foreign Minister Anna Lindh issued a press statement expressing concern about the potential negative consequences the unilateral withdrawal by the United States from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty could have on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and urging the United States to continue its consultations , in particular with the Russian Federation and China respectively . Preparations for the session of the Preparatory Committee in 2002 In autumn 2001 , Sweden , through Ambassador Henrik Salander , Permanent Representative of Sweden to the Conference on Disarmament , was appointed Chair of the first session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , to be held in New York in April 2002 . During winter and spring 2002 , Sweden , through Ambassador Salander , prepared for the first session of the Preparatory Committee by consulting with all States parties to the Treaty . Sweden also participated actively in the New Agenda's preparations for the Preparatory Committee session . A position paper was drafted stating fundamental principles of nuclear disarmament , taking stock of the developments since the 2000 Review Conference and making short-term and long-term suggestions for the way ahead . The New Agenda also prepared statements to be held in the general debate and in the cluster debate about nuclear disarmament and released a press statement preceding the opening of the Preparatory Committee session . The New Agenda will continue to be active in the period leading up to the opening meeting of the First Committee of the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session . In spring 2002 , the European Union prepared a Statement to be delivered on behalf of the Union at the first session of the Preparatory Committee , during the general debate . Conference on Disarmament The Conference on Disarmament has not been able to agree on a programme of work and has thus remained idle in the period following the 2000 Review Conference . Several decisions of the Conference included in the 13-step action plan have therefore not yet materialized : the commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty and consideration of the questions of nuclear disarmament in subsidiary bodies of the Conference on Disarmament . In February 2002 , the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs , Ms. Anna Lindh , spoke in the Conference on Disarmament . The speech covered the whole disarmament agenda : weapons of mass destruction as well as conventional weapons . A significant part of the speech was devoted to nuclear disarmament , emphasizing issues such as an early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty , universality of and compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the principle of irreversibility in nuclear reductions , etc. Ms. Lindh also called upon the Conference on Disarmament to agree on a programme of work and expressed Sweden's readiness to accept the Amorim proposal in order to start negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty as well as to start dealing with nuclear disarmament and the prevention of an arms race in outer space . In February 2002 , the European Union , under the Presidency of Spain , delivered a statement in the Conference on Disarmament calling for the commencement of work in the Conference . Destruction of nuclear weapons The primary responsibility for the destruction of nuclear weapons rests with the countries concerned , i . e . the nuclear-weapon States . Sweden believes , however , that international cooperation is essential . Thus Sweden has agreed , on invitation , to participate as an observer in the successor group to the G8 Plutonium Disposition Planning Group . The new group will be launched in the near future . Sweden agrees with the G8 Group that it is critical to ensure that excess weapons-grade plutonium resulting from arms reduction is managed and disposed of in such a way that it can no longer be available for future use or diversion for nuclear weapons . Sweden has a great deal of expertise available in the fields of nuclear safety , safeguards and nuclear fuel and waste management . Thus Sweden has been able to provide cooperation and assistance to Russia and other countries members of the Commonwealth of Independent States in the field of nuclear non-proliferation , including : regulatory frameworks , material accounting and protection , export / import controls and management of spent nuclear fuel ( e . g . from Russian submarines and ice-breakers ) . Most of this takes place in cooperation with other countries , the European Union and the International Atomic Energy Agency . Sweden also has taken an active part in conferences organized under the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Cooperation Initiative and its predecessor the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative . Sweden has been contributing from the outset to the International Science and Technology Centre in Moscow and was one of the funding parties of the Science and Technology Centre in Ukraine . These two centres were set up to provide former Soviet weapon scientists with employment opportunities in the civilian sector . Safeguards Agreement Before Sweden became a member of the European Union in 1995 , the safeguards agreement requirement by article III of the NPT was satisfied by the Safeguards Agreement between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Sweden . 3 In the context of Sweden's accession to the European Union , notifications to the Agency by Sweden and by the European Atomic Energy Community , as required by the Safeguards Agreement between non-nuclear-weapon States of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community , and the Agency , 4 were received by the IAEA on 24 May 1995 . For practical accounting purposes , as proposed in the notifications , the Agreement came into force with regard to Sweden on 1 June 1995.5 On the same date , the previous Swedish Safeguards Agreement with the Agency was suspended . 6 With regard to the Additional Protocol , Sweden , as a member of the European Union , has fulfilled its own requirements for entry into force . Additional Protocols for the EU member States will enter into force on the date when the Agency receives written notification from the EU States and Euratom that their respective requirements for entry into force have been met . Illicit trafficking In May 2001 , Sweden hosted an International Conference on illicit trafficking of fissile material and other radioactive sources and physical protection . The Conference , with participants from 70 countries , was organized by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate . Export control As a supplier of nuclear commodities , Sweden participates in the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers Group . The implementation of our obligation under article III , paragraph 2 , of the Non-Proliferation Treaty is ensured by means of controlling exports from Sweden in accordance with EU Council regulation ( EC ) 1334 / 2000 . In the view of Sweden , an effective domestic export control system also facilitates cooperation for peaceful purposes in the nuclear field . Nuclear energy for peaceful purposes Traditionally Sweden attaches great importance to the Agency's Technical Cooperation Programme . Over the years , Sweden has paid its full target share to the Technical Cooperation Fund , and Sweden also hosts a number of technical and scientific visits for students from developing countries . Regional treaties At the fifty-fifth and fifty-sixth sessions of the United Nations General Assembly , Sweden voted in favour of resolutions and decisions calling for regional nuclear-weapon-free zones . They are : • Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East – resolutions 55 / 30 and 56 / 21 ; • Establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Asia – resolution 55 / 33 W and decision 56 / 412 ; • Nuclear-weapon-free southern hemisphere and adjacent areas – resolutions 55 / 33 I and 56 / 24 G ; • Consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean ( Treaty of Tlatelolco ) – resolutions 55 / 39 and 56 / 30 ; • African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty ( Treaty of Pelindaba ) – resolution 56 / 17 .

"SARAH GREEN: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I'm Sarah Green. This week, we're featuring excerpts from an interview with Muhtar Kent, the CEO of Coca-Cola. He recently sat down with our editor-in-chief, Adi Ignatius. First, we asked him to tell us about his vision for the company after becoming CEO. MUHTAR KENT: One of the first things that I said to myself when I became CEO was we need a vision, a shared picture of success for 10 years down the road. And we called it, Vision 2020, a road map for winning together with our bottling partners, which called essentially for us to double the business in 10 years, i.e., do in 10 years what we've done in 125 years. Not something for the fainthearted but something clearly doable to become the best place to work to ensure that we created a shared wealth with all our stakeholders. And it required us to do things very differently to grow our core business and for us to continue to crack the code of growth. And we are in the seventh quarter now of that vision, so almost two years will be completed. And we got eight years to go. And we're on track. We're on track because our brands have got much stronger. The brand metrics over the last three years, we have not wasted this crisis. We created a transformation that we were able to generate over half a billion dollars of savings in unnecessary expenses and reallocate some of that funding to help fuel our brands for brand health. The metrics of our brands are much better, better than we've ever seen. We have long term investments with our bottling partners. And there's a great belief in the future, because we've been able to communicate to all concerned-- our people, our bottlers, our customers that this is a great business that still has tremendous amounts of growth. US business had not grown for the past six, seven years. And we were able to prove to ourselves that there's growth in this wonderful market in the United States. So first thing was to create a vision, start implementing that vision, and secondly, to start restoring growth to the United States. Those were the two big priorities for me. And both we were able to create that vision, start executing it. And last three quarters of last year, we generated organic growth in the United States. SARAH GREEN: But growth in the United States isn't something most major multinationals are pursuing. In fact, most multinationals now seem focused on growth in emerging markets. So we wanted to know, with more than 1,000 factories and over 200 markets around the world, why Coca-Cola still considers the US a growth market. MUHTAR KENT: Most people thought that we were trying to go to the moon with a glider when we talked about growth and the United States. They thought it was a oxymoron, growth in the US. This year that we're in, we invested $3.3 billion last year. This year, we'll probably invest more than $3.5 billion when it's done. And here are the reasons why. The US is a growing demographic. It's the only Western nation that has a growing demographic. This country is going to add at least 30 million people to its population in our vision time period, 10 years. Secondly, it's a diverse population. It's an enterprising, entrepreneurial population. Half of all skilled people that immigrate around the world come to the United States, half. So it's an influx of skilled people. It's an enterprising hat. More than 60% of the patents registered in the world are here, innovative population, diverse. And lastly, it's a giving nation, the biggest giving nation in the world. $300 billion dollars of giving takes place in the United States per annum. That's greater than the GDP of many big countries like Egypt and so forth. So all of that basically to me translates into an enterprising nation where you can grow your business with all the wealth that is still generated in the United States. So yes, we have our problems. But I still think this is a great nation where we can grow our business. SARAH GREEN: Of course, targeting different geographic markets isn't the only way to grow. Companies can always target an adjacent product category. With alcohol consumption on the rise, we ask Kent why Coca-Cola wasn't getting into the business of alcoholic beverages. MUHTAR KENT: Here's a simple reason. In the next 10 years in this vision period, demographics tell us any way you slice and dice it, there's going to be roughly between 800 to a billion people that come into the middle class in the world. You will have another 800 million people urbanized, the biggest urbanization the world has ever know. That means roughly a city the size of New York being created every couple of months in the world in the next 10 years. So new middle class on the go urban lifestyles translate into a significant demand for nonalcoholic ready to drink beverages. About 4% to 5% growth, just the industry will grow. And we're saying, look, this is such a beautiful business. Why would I want to lose focus? We believe in our business. Every morning when I get up, I look at myself in the mirror, and I say I'm very fortunate that I'm not selling refrigerators. I'm not selling real estate. And I'm not selling plane tickets. But I'm selling moments of pleasure at cents at a time billions of times a day. SARAH GREEN: All companies are under the gun on finding cleaner and greener ways to operate. But beverage companies are especially in the spotlight. They use a lot of water. And they deliver their products to plastic bottles. So we ask Kent how he reconciles the need to go green with a need to earn a profit. MUHTAR KENT: The beauty of some of these things is that they're actually very good for business too. When we say water neutrality, how do we achieve water neutrality for a company like Coca-Cola that uses currently 350 billion liters of water a year for its products for its business? How can you achieve that? Because water neutrality means you give back liter for liter what you use. That's the definition of water neutrality. You do that through three things, reducing the amount of water in your 1,000 factories. You do it through recycling the water that you give back to the cities that you don't need to put in your product that you've used. And thirdly, the two are not enough to get you to water neutrality. You have water harvesting projects for communities around the world. And you let someone else measure that for you, incredible NGO partner, which in our case is a worldwide life fund, to measure it for you. Now the great thing about this is that when you reduce water, your costs go down. So it's part of a great business philosophy. It's no longer anymore I want to say nice things, and I want to have a nice report. Similarly, plant bottle. No one ever thought you could make a PT bottle with the same characteristics for shelf life and other things that are costs from using partly plants. No one ever thought it was possible. And then part of our innovation generated a breakthrough. And by the way, for us, innovation is not only inside the four walls of the company. We have incubation projects many parts of the world because we think that the Coca-Cola company and the system is too big to have embryonic ideas flourish. So we have outside parts of the world innovation incubation projects. And this idea actually for the plant bottle came from India. It was an Indian breakthrough, part of our incubation there. And now we're able to use the waste of sugar cane more less, i.e., to create resin to blend with fossil fuel. And as petrol prices go up, the cost of virgin resin goes up. But now the blended plant bottle is actually going to give us a constant advantage. SARAH GREEN: But sustainability isn't the only challenge facing the beverage industry. There's that whole obesity epidemic. The soft drink industry has been getting hammered for producing what some people call liquid candy. So if Coca-Cola wants to be a good corporate citizen, why do they even make sugary drinks anymore? MUHTAR KENT: Well, the key in the world to have a better future is to collectively first define the problem. Collectively, I mean government business and civil society. We cannot as business solve these very big complex issues in the world like obesity, neither can a government on its own, and neither can an NGO on its own. But I call it the golden triangle of business, government, and civil society coming together closely can certainly have a better chance at creating solutions to complex problems. This is a complex problem. It is a problem where if you take all the innovation, all the work that we have done with our beverages, we've reduced the calories in our beverages significantly over the last 20 years. And at the same time in the last 20 years, obesity rates have gone up in this country, significantly. But at the same time, the number of steps that an adult in the United States, a young adult is taking has gone down from 3,000 to 1,000. So you're beginning to understand why this is such a complex problem. And what we're doing though is providing choice to the consumer-- products with no calories like the one you're drinking now, products with medium calories, products will full calories. For every single one of our main brands in the United States that we offer to the consumer, there is a non-caloric version merchandised effectively next to it. And I think that the only way that we're going to solve this problem is keep innovating non-nutritive natural sweeteners like Vitamin Water Zero which has stevia, which is a non-nutritive natural sweetener, but also ensure that we can be a very meaningful part of the solution, working closer with government, local, sub-national, as well as national, and with civil society. Choice is key. You cannot solve this problem by saying I'm not going to sell certain products, because they're many people that will still love to drink a full calorie beverage. And they have no connection to obesity because they exercise sufficiently. It's about knowledge. It's about the understanding of energy balance and a lack of understanding of energy balance that creates issues and problems. And therefore, we all have a responsibility to raise awareness of energy balance and raise awareness for the need for effective active lifestyle programs. SARAH GREEN: Finally, on the issue of leadership, we asked Kent how he had to shift gears after taking the top job. MUHTAR KENT: I would say not a huge shift, but one of the things that I've learned when I became CEO is you just have to be much more careful about the words you use, and how you use them, and when you use them. Because an organization sometimes just takes off and follows a word when you absolutely never intended that. So rounding off, speaking certainly not directive, but much in a more sort of general sense is something that I've learned from the first day on. Probably for the first two, three months, I wasn't aware because the language that you use as a CEO or head of international is not taken to be the sort of rule of the land, whereas sometimes the language you use as CEO, whether it's with a bottler, whether it's with town hall meetings, I learned is something that needs to be in a different context. And that's something that I learned the hard way. SARAH GREEN: That was Coca-Cola's CEO Muhtar Kent.

"How to Motivate and Counsel Your Sales Force Lead from the Front with Respect-Building Attention to Your Team's Concerns The salesperson personality is unique . Managing salespeople effectively requires motivating and counseling them on a far more elevated level than ordinary employees need . A powerful way to meet this sales management challenge is to create a highly motivated work environment . To help a strong performer to get past a slump , the soft approach is most likely to succeed . Question the salesperson as to where you have failed , rather than making intrusive demands to know what 's wrong with him or her . Lead from the front with respect-building attention to your team's concerns . Driving from the rear with the whip of intimidation probably never worked well ; today it makes building and retaining a strong sales team virtually impossible .",2,2

"[ 31 January 2002 ] Paragraphs Page History 2 - 41 4 Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan 42 - 48 11 C. Aggression by the Republic of Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan 49 - 53 11 Efforts to mediate a settlement to the conflict 54 - 58 12 The Republic of Azerbaijan lies in the borderlands of Asia and Europe . It is situated in the south-eastern part of the southern Caucasus and shares borders in the north with the Russian Federation , the south with the Islamic Republic of Iran , the west with Turkey , Georgia and Armenia and in the east its neighbours across the Caspian Sea are Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan . The Autonomous Republic of Naxçivan is part of the Republic of Azerbaijan . History Scholars consider Azerbaijan to include "" the land populated today by the Azeri Turks , the people who inhabit the region stretching from the northern slopes of the Caucuses mountains along the Caspian Sea to the Iranian plateau "" . Azerbaijan is among the areas of earliest human settlement , with evidence of human habitation since the Palaeolithic age . Settlements engaging in agriculture and livestock-raising were widely distributed about this area in the seventh and sixth millennia BC . Rock paintings in Gobustan near Baku are dated by scholars to the end of the seventh and beginning of the sixth millennia BC . The well-known Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdal , who made special trips to Baku in 1979 and 1994 to study these rock paintings , believes that the shores of the Caspian Sea were the cradle for the civilization which then spread over water , southward and northward . Heyerdal found support for his hypothesis not only in the Gobustan petroglyphs of reed boats , remarkably similar to those depicted centuries later by the Vikings on the walls of caves in Norway , but also in sagas written down in the middle ages . The Gobustan rock paintings of boats surmounted by an image of the sun also attest irrefutably to the ties between the early settlements of Azerbaijan and the Sumero / Akkadian civilization of Mesopotamia , whose cultural legacy includes very similar depictions . In the third millennium BC and the early years of the second millennium BC , signs appear of the emergence of the first class societies , with a proto-urban civilization and embryonic state structures . It is at this time that the tribal alliances were formed of the Aratta , the Gutians and the Lullubites . According to Sumerian cuneiform sources , the first State to arise on the territory of historical Azerbaijan was the state of Aratta , which came into being in the first half of the third millennium BC in the area to the south and south-east of lake Urmia . From about 2300 BC , the second State of ancient Azerbaijan sprang up in the area south of lake Urmia - the state of Lullubum . The Gutian state was formed later in the second half of the third millennium BC in the area west and south-west of lake Urmia . In 2175 BC , the Gutians conquered Sumer and Akkad and ruled over them for the next 100 years . The ancient states of Azerbaijan , which maintained political , economic and cultural ties with Sumer and Akkad and formed part of the wider civilization of Mesopotamia , were governed by dynasties of Turkic descent . The Turkophone peoples which have inhabited the area of Azerbaijan since ancient times were fire-worshippers and adherents of one of the world's oldest religions - Zoroastrianism . The country's name , in its current form , is derived from a Turkic collocation meaning "" land , noble people , keepers of the flame "" . Over the period from the late ninth to the seventh centuries BC , the Mannaean kingdom held sway in the area of lake Urmia . The Cimmerian-Scythian-Saka kingdom flourished in the seventh and sixth centuries BC in the south-west of Azerbaijan . In the 670s BC , the Mannaean kingdom arose in the territory of Azerbaijan and was overthrown by the Persian Achaemenid kingdom in the mid-sixth century BC . A vital role was played in Azerbaijani history by the kingdom of Atropatene , which came into existence in the southern part of the country in the 520s BC and which was heavily influenced by Hellenism . The Caucasian Albanian state was created in the north of Azerbaijan in the third millennium BC , with the river Araxes as its southern frontier . This state successfully held out against the constant aggression of the Armenian state , which was then destroyed by the Romans in 66 BC . The people of Albania included a number of different nationalities , most of which spoke Turkic languages . Christianity was adopted in Albania in 313 . The territory of Albania also included the mountainous part of Karabagh , which was known at that time as Artsakh . Over the period from the first to the fourth centuries , when the entire Caucasus area was under the Roman yoke , Albania remained the only independent state and with its political independence came a flowering of Albanian learning , language and literature . This same period say the growing strength and influence of the autocephalous Albanian Catholicosate and of the Albanian Church in general , which was independent of the other Christian churches and even propagated Christianity among the north Caucasian and Turkophone peoples . Following the invasion by the Arabs , the dominant religion from the early eighth century in Azerbaijan became Islam . Most of the Albanians also converted to Islam and only a minority retained their former religion . Bowing to the influence of the Byzantine Empire in the southern Caucasus , the Albanian Church , together with the Georgian Church , had accepted the dyophysite doctrine shortly before the Arab invasion . To create a barrier to the influence of Byzantine , the Caliphate - enlisting the help of the Armenian Church - steered the Albanian Church towards monophysitism and brought it under the dominion of the monophysite Armenian Gregorian Church , opening the way for the subsequent gradual Gregorianization of the Albanians living in the mountainous areas of Karabagh - or Artsakh . The cohabitation of the populations of Albania and Atropatene within the confines of a single state and their profession of one and the same religion helped ensure the consolidation of the people of Azerbaijan . The notions of freedom , independence and universal equality nurtured the Hurramite movement , led by Babak , which flourished in Azerbaijan in the early ninth century . Following the anti-Caliphate rising by the local population , several new states arose in the territory of Azerbaijan in the ninth century , the most powerful of which was the State of Shirvan , with its capital at Shemakha , which was ruled by the Shirvanshah dynasty . This endured until the sixteenth century and played an enormous role in the history of medieval Azerbaijan . The independent states of the Sajids , Salarids , Ravvadids ( with their capital at Tabriz ) and Shaddadids ( with their capital at Ganja ) arose from the ninth to the eleventh centuries in the territory of Azerbaijan . Azerbaijan was ruled by the Seljuk dynasty from the end of the eleventh century . Over the period 1136-1225 , the Atabek Eldegiz state held sway in Azerbaijan . The sharing by the country's indigenous population of a common Turkic language and Turkic provenance and their adherence to the same Islamic faith made possible a process of consolidation of the Azerbaijani nation which reached its culmination in the eleventh and twelfth centuries . This same period saw the greatest flowering of the culture of Azerbaijan , which bequeathed to the world an array of illustrious philosophers , architects , poets and scholars . The crowning achievement of Azerbaijani social and cultural thought of that period was the work of Nizami Ganjavi ( 1141-1209 ) , poet and philosopher , now one of the treasures of the world's cultural heritage . The twelfth and thirteenth centuries saw the rise to prominence , in the mountainous regions of Karabagh , of the Khachen principality , ruled by the Albanian kings . The rule of Hasan Jalal ( 1215-1262 ) ushered in an Albanian renaissance and saw the completion of the construction of Gandzasar monastery complex , whose cathedral was to become the centre of the early church and whose consecration was presided over by the Catholicos of Albania . From the mid-thirteenth century , the Azerbaijani states became vassels of the Mongol Hulagid dynasty ( 1258-1356 ) . In the mid-fourteenth century , following an uprising by the local population to cast off the yoke of the invaders , the local Jalairid feudal lords took up the reins of power and , with the support of the Azerbaijani nobility , established the Jalairid state ( 1359-1410 ) . From the end of the fourteenth century , Azerbaijan was repeatedly invaded by Tamberlaine and served as the theatre for his battles with the Golden Horde . The Turkmen dynasties of Qara-Qoyunlu and Aq-Qoyunlu ruled over Azerbaijan in 1410-1468 and 1468-1501 and under them Azerbaijan grew significantly in power . In 1501 , the Safavid state was formed in Azerbaijan , named after the ruling dynasty , with its capital at Tabriz . Under this dynasty , all the lands of Azerbaijan were united , for the first time in their history , into a single Azerbaijani state . The territory of the Safavid state stretched from the Amu Darya river to the Euphrates , and from Derbent to the shores of the Persian Gulf . This polity was created and developed as an essentially Azerbaijani state and all political power remained in the hands of the Azerbaijani feudal nobility . Senior court officials , military generals and provincial governors were all appointed from among the Azerbaijani nobility . The army was made up from the militia of the most powerful Azerbaijani clans . Azeri was the official language of the Safavid state . By the end of the sixteenth century , the capital of the Safavid state had been transferred to Isfahan and its shah now drew his support primarily from the Persian nobility . The State , while ruled by an Azerbaijan dynasty , took on an increasingly Persian aspect . In the 1740s , with the weakening of the power exercised by the Persian shahs over the territory of Azerbaijan , the country disintegrated into some 20 khanates , namely , Ardabil , Baku , Ganja , Derbent , Erivan , Javad , Karabagh , Karadagh , Khoi , Maku , Maragin , Nakhichevan , Quba , Salyan , Sarab , Shirvan , Sheki , Tabriz , Talysh and Urumi . In addition to these khanates , the country was further subdivided into the sultanates of Kazah-Samshadil , Borchala , Ilisu , Araxes , Gutgashen and Gabala . Upper Karabagh , which was inhabited by Azerbaijani Muslims and Albanian Christians , formed an integral part of the Azerbaijani khanate of Karabagh , which covered the territories lying between the Kura and Araxes rivers . The local duchies - or "" melikdoms "" - of Dizak , Varanda , Khachen , Jeraberd and Gulistan , all of which lay within the mountainous regions of Karabagh , also formed part of this khanate , to which their inhabitants owed allegiance as vassals . At the end of the eighteenth and in the first third of the nineteenth centuries , Azerbaijan was fought over by the Persian , Russian and Ottoman empires , each eager to secure hegemony over this country whose geopolitical situation lent it significant strategic advantages . A number of the khanates rose in arms to defend their sovereignty , while others were forced , in an effort to defend their own interests , to conclude agreements reducing them to the status of vassaldom . Thus , on 14 May 1805 , a treaty was signed on the banks of the river Kura with the Azerbaijani khan , Ibrahim Halil , under which the independent Azerbaijani khanate of Karabagh was placed under Russian overlordship . This treaty has particular resonance today , since it demonstrates that Karabagh historically formed part of Azerbaijan . The first Russo-Persian war of 1804-1813 , fought to establish dominance over the Azerbaijani khanates , resulted in the first division of Azerbaijani territories between Russia and Persia . The peace treaty of Gulistan , signed on 12 October 1813 by Russia and Persia , gave legal recognition to the effective annexation by Russia over the period 1800-1806 of the khanates of northern Azerbaijan , with the exception of Nakhichevan and Erivan . The second Russo-Persian war of 1826-1828 led , on 10 February 1828 , to the signing of the Turkmanchai peace treaty , under which Persia officially renounced its claims to northern Azerbaijan and finally recognized its annexation , with the inclusion of the Nakhichevan and Erivan khanates , by Russia . It is important to stress that all the khanates listed above , including Karabagh , were annexed to Russia as purely Azerbaijani possessions . They were Azerbaijani by virtue of their predominantly Azeri populations and the ethnic composition of their dominant feudal elite ( the khans themselves , the major landowners , the clergy etc. ) . Under the Treaty of Turkmanchai and the peace treaty concluded in Edirne in 1829 , the Armenians then inhabiting Persia and the Ottoman empire were relocated to Azerbaijan , primarily to the khanates of Nakhichevan , Erivan and Karabagh . Thus , the Russian scholar K. Shavrov records that , over the period 1828-1830 alone , some 40,000 Persian and 84,000 Turkish Armenians were relocated in the Trans-Caucasus , where they were settled in the best indigenous lands of the Yelisavetpol ( Karabagh ) and Erivan provinces , where the Armenian population had previously been negligible and where they were allocated 200,000 dessiatines ( 225 , 000 hectares ) of State land . In his notebooks , the Russian diplomat and playwright Alexander Griboedov wrote : "" For the most part , the Armenians were settled on the estates of Mohammedan landowners ( ... ) . These new settlers are crowding out the Mohammedans ( ... ) . We have also given careful thought to the council which must be given to the Mohammedans , so as to reconcile them to this aggravation , which will not be long in duration , and to dispel any apprehensions which they may have that the Armenians will take permanent possession of the lands where they have been initially settled . "" The American academic Justin McCarthy adduces the following facts about the settlement of the Southern Caucasus and , in particular , Azerbaijan , by Armenians . Between 1828 and 1920 , in pursuit of a policy designed to change the entire demographic make-up of Azerbaijan so that Armenians would outnumber Azerbaijanis , more than 2 million Muslims were forcibly expelled and an unknown number killed . On two occasions , in 1828 and 1854 , the Russians invaded eastern Anatolia and on both occasions they left , taking with them 100,000 Armenian sympathizers to the Caucasus , where they took the place of Turks - i . e . Azerbaijanis - who had emigrated or died . In the war of 1877-1878 , Russia seized the district of Kars-Ardahan , driving out the Muslim population and settling 70,000 Armenians in their homes . Some 60,000 Armenians resettled in the Russian Caucasus during the troubles of 1895-1896 . Finally , the migrations of the First World War resulted in an almost even exchange of 400,000 Armenians from eastern Anatolia for 400,000 Muslims from the Caucasus . According to McCarthy's information , between 1828 and 1920 some 560,000 Armenians were resettled in Azerbaijan . In other words , it was actually after the conquest of the southern Caucasus by Russia that the Armenian population of the Azerbaijani lands north of the river Araxes increased so dramatically . When we look at Karabagh , we see from official records for 1810 - in other words , shortly before its annexation by Russia - that the khanate of Karabagh had some 12,000 households , of which 9,500 were Azerbaijani and a mere 2,500 Armenian . According to data for 1823 , there was one town in the Karabagh khanate - Shusha - and some 600 villages , 450 of which were Azerbaijani and about 150 Armenian , with a total population of some 90,000 . The relative figures for Azerbaijani and Armenian households in Shusha were 1,048 and 474 , and in the countryside , 12,902 and 4,331 , respectively . The Armenians living in Karabagh were in fact descendents of the local Albanian population , which had been extensively Armenianized . Thus , the Armenian writer B. Ishkhanian points out that the Armenians residing in Nagorny Karabakh are in part indigenous , descended from the ancient Albanians , and in part refugees from Turkey and Persia , for whom the Azerbaijani lands offered a refuge from persecution and oppression . Under a decree promulgated by Tsar Nicholas I on 21 March 1828 , the Azerbaijani khanates of Nakhichevan and Erivan were dissolved and replaced by a new administrative entity known as the "" Armenian oblast "" , administered by Russian officials ; in 1849 , the Armenian oblast was renamed the province ( "" guberniya "" ) of Erivan . In pursuit of their ultimate goals , the Armenians persuaded the Russian authorities to abolish the Albanian Christian patriarchate , which had been in operation in Azerbaijan , and to transfer its property to the Armenian Church . Following the loss of their state sovereignty and distinct confessional identity , the local Albanian population in the western regions of former Albania - the Karabagh region - into which Armenian settlers continued to pour , gradually started to undergo a process of Gregorianization , or Armenianization . After the revolutionary events of 1917 in Russia , the processes of disintegration of the country became more pronounced and the conditions were ripe for the formation , in outlying ethnic regions of the former Russian Empire , of independent States . Thus , on 28 May 1918 , the Azerbaijani Democratic Republic was proclaimed in the territory of the eastern part of the southern Caucasus - the first parliamentary democracy in the Islamic east - which was to play a historic role in the renaissance and formation of the sense of ethnic identity and statehood of the Azerbaijani nation . The development of the Azerbaijani Democratic Republic , both as a nation and as a State , was based on the doctrine of "" Azerbaijanism "" , which hinged on the principles of modernism , Islamism and Turanism , symbolizing the Azerbaijani people's aspiration for progress based on preservation of their adherence to Islamic civilization and Turkic culture and on their separate ethnic identity . In its brief existence of less than two years , the multi-party Azerbaijani parliament and the coalition Government managed to take a number of important steps in the process of nation-building and the development of statehood , and in such areas as education , formation of an army , development of independent financial and economic systems and securing international recognition for the young republic as a full member of the international community of nations . On 11 January 1920 , the Paris Peace Conference , with the Treaty of Versailles , accorded de facto recognition of the independence of the Azerbaijani Republic , to whose capital - Baku - 20 countries had already sent their representatives . In late 1919 and early 1920 , however , the political situation of the Azerbaijani Democratic Republic - both at home and abroad - worsened considerably . The country found itself caught up in a ferocious tug-of-war between the countries of the Entente , Turkey , Russia and Persia , each pursuing its own geopolitical goals in this strategically important and oil-rich area . The political decision by the Bolshevist Government of the Russian Socialist Federative Republic ( RSFSR ) not to recognize the Azerbaijani Democratic Republic , the deployment of the Eleventh Red Army on the frontiers of the Azerbaijani Republic in Spring 1920 , the aggression waged by Dashnak-ruled Armenia against Azerbaijan in Karabagh and Zangezur , the terrorist strikes by Armenian groups and the Bolsheviks against the peaceful Azerbaijani population inside Azerbaijan and the social and economic crisis gripping the country - all these factors combined to bring about the weakening of the Azerbaijani Democratic Republic and led to the occupation of its capital by the Eleventh Army on 27-28 April 1920 . As stated in a telegram from the general staff of the Caucasian front to the Eleventh Army command , dated 1 May 1920 , RSFSR troops had been instructed to take possession of the entire territory of Azerbaijan lying within the confines of the former Russian Empire , but without crossing the Persian border . The 70 years during which it formed part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) marked a new , important stage in the development of Azerbaijani statehood , during which the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic forged ahead in its social , economic and cultural development . At the same time , the Soviet period also saw many negative trends emerge in Azerbaijan , as elsewhere throughout the USSR . At the economic level , the country became a reservoir of fuel , raw materials and agricultural produce for the Soviet economy . At the cultural level , the imposition of the Cyrillic alphabet in the place of the Latin alphabet severed the country's ties with the fountainhead Azerbaijani literature and culture . The Soviet regime was at pains to suppress any efforts by the Azerbaijani intelligentsia to manifest their separate ethnic identity and to study the true history of their country . During the Soviet period , the territories of Zangezur , Gekcha , part of Naxçivan and other districts were hived off from Azerbaijan and attached to neighbouring Armenia . As a result , the country's area , which during the period of the Azerbaijani Democratic Republic , in 1920 , had measured 114,000 square kilometres was reduced during the period 1920-1921 to 86,600 square kilometres . In addition , on 7 July 1923 , on the initiative of the Moscow leaders of the Bolshevist part , the so-called Nagorny Karabakh autonomous region , with a predominantly Armenian population , was artificially carved out of a part of the territory of historical Karabagh , the majority of whose population had been Azerbaijanis . That decision marked the first step in the political campaign to amputate Nagorny Karabakh from the rest of Azerbaijan . During the years 1988-1990 , the national democratic movement in Azerbaijan campaigned vigorously for the restoration of the country's independence . With a view to suppressing this movement , on 20 January 1990 , with the approval of the Soviet leadership under Mikhail Gorbachev , Soviet army units were dispatched to Baku . Their reprisals , which were conducted with uncommon savagery , left hundreds of innocent Azerbaijani citizens dead and wounded . A state of emergency was declared in the country and this remained in force until mid-1991 . Notwithstanding these setbacks , the untiring struggle for independence by the patriotic forces of the Azerbaijani people culminated in the adoption on 31 August 1991 , by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Azerbaijan , of a declaration on the restoration of the State independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan . On 18 October 1991 saw the passage of the act establishing the State independence of the Republic of Azerbaijan , which set out the foundations for the statehood of an independent Azerbaijan and determined the principles of its political and economic structure . With that act , the Republic of Azerbaijan once again , after a 71-year interval , became an independent subject of international law . Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan Following a referendum on 12 November 1995 , the new Constitution of the Azerbaijani Republic was adopted and entered into force on 5 December 1995 . The country's basic law was developed in line with the fundamental principles and norms of international law . As stipulated by article 1 of the Constitution , "" In the Republic of Azerbaijan , the Azerbaijani people shall be the sole source of State power "" . Under article 2 of the Constitution , the people of Azerbaijan shall exercise their sovereign right directly through nationwide voting ( referendums ) and through representatives elected on the basis of universal , equal and direct suffrage by free , secret and personal ballot . Article 7 of the Constitution stipulates that the Azerbaijani State shall be a democratic , constitutional , secular and unitary republic . In Azerbaijan , the power of the State shall be restricted in domestic matters only by the country's law and , in foreign affairs , only by the provisions arising from international treaties to which the Republic of Azerbaijan is a party . State power in the Republic of Azerbaijan shall be based on the principle of the following division of powers : ( a ) Legislative power shall be exercised by the Milli Meclis ( parliament ) of the Republic of Azerbaijan ; ( b ) Executive power rests with the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan ; ( c ) Judicial power shall be exercised by the courts of the Republic of Azerbaijan . Pursuant to the Constitution , the legislature , executive and judiciary shall interact with one another and be independent within their various jurisdictions . Article 8 of the Constitution states that the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan shall be the head of State . For the purpose of organizing the administration of executive power , the President of the Republic shall establish a cabinet of ministers , which shall serve as the supreme organ of executive power of the President of the Republic and shall be answerable and subordinate to the head of State . As stipulated by article 125 of the Constitution , judicial power in Azerbaijan shall be exercised only by the courts and on the basis of due process . The courts comprise the Constitutional Court , the Supreme Court , the Economic Court , and the general and special courts . C. Aggression by the Republic of Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan While still part of the USSR , Azerbaijan already encountered threats against its territorial integrity and security . In February 1988 a decision was taken by the regional council of the Nagorny Karabakh autonomous region of the Azerbaijan SSR , without the participation of any Azerbaijani deputies , for the withdrawal of the Nagorny Karabakh autonomous region from Azerbaijan and its annexation to Armenia . On 1 December 1989 , the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR took a decision , which has never been rescinded , on the annexation of the Nagorny Karabakh region of Azerbaijan to Armenia . These decisions contravene the constitutions of the USSR and the Azerbaijan SSR . In 1988 , Azerbaijanis living in Armenia started to be driven out of the country . The Soviet authorities proved incapable of halting these unconstitutional acts by Armenia and preventing raids into Azerbaijani territory by paramilitary formations and terrorist groups . At the time the Nagorny Karabakh conflict first erupted , there were some 186,100 people living in the region , of whom 138,600 were Armenians ( 73 . 5 per cent ) and 47,500 Azerbaijanis ( 25 . 3 per cent ) . Full-scale military operations commenced in late 1991 and early 1992 . Armenian military units launched combat operations in Nagorny Karabakh with the use of the latest weapons and these culminated in February 1992 with the seizure of the town of Khojaly , in the course of which more than 600 civilians were killed , including women , children and old people , and with the occupation in May 1992 of the town of Shusha and of Shusha district . Following these actions , the entire Azerbaijani population was expelled from Nagorny Karabakh and the occupation of the territory was completed . With the seizure of Lachin in May 1992 , the territory of Nagorny Karabakh was joined to Armenia . After this , hostilities spread further through Azerbaijan , passing beyond the administrative frontiers of the Nagorny Karabakh region , and also crossing the Armenian-Azerbaijani frontier . A further six Azerbaijani districts were occupied by Armenia . As a result , Armenian aggression against the Republic of Azerbaijan led to the occupation of more than 17,000 square kilometres , constituting some 20 per cent of the country's territory , more than 50,000 people were wounded or left disabled and more than 18,000 people killed , and 877 settlements , 100,000 homes , more than 1,000 economic facilities , more than 600 schools and colleges , 250 medical centres and most of the architectural monuments situated within the occupied area were looted or destroyed . As a result of Armenian aggression and ethnic cleansing of Azerbaijanis , both from the territory of Armenia itself and from occupied Azerbaijani lands , there are now some 1 million refugees and displaced persons in Azerbaijan . Efforts to mediate a settlement to the conflict Efforts to mediate a settlement to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict were launched in February 1992 in the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( CSCE ) . At their meeting in Helsinki on 24 March 1992 , the CSCE Council of Ministers decided to convene a conference on Nagorny Karabakh in Minsk , under the auspices of CSCE as the standing body for negotiations to reach a peaceful settlement to conflicts on the basis of the Conference's principles , obligations and provisions . In its resolutions 822 ( 1993 ) of 30 April 1993 , 853 ( 1993 ) of 29 July 1993 , 874 ( 1993 ) of 14 October 1993 and 884 ( 1993 ) of 12 November 1993 , the United Nations Security Council condemned the occupation of the territory of Azerbaijan Republic , reaffirmed respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and inviolability of the borders of the Azerbaijani Republic and the inadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territory , and demanded the immediate cessation of armed hostilities and hostile acts , as well as the immediate , complete and unconditional withdrawal of all occupying forces from the occupied districts of Azerbaijan . A ceasefire has been in place since May 1994 . At the CSCE Budapest Summit on 5 and 6 December 1994 , it was decided that the heads of State and Government of the countries members of CSCE would launch a process under the co-Chairmen of the Minsk Conference to coordinate all efforts to mediate a resolution of the conflict within the framework of CSCE . The Budapest Summit set the Chairman-in-Office of CSCE the task of conducting negotiations for the conclusion of a political agreement on the cessation of the armed conflict , the implementation of which would eliminate major consequences of the conflict and permit the convening of the Minsk Conference . A decision was also taken at the Summit to deploy a multinational CSCE peacekeeping force , following agreement among the parties for cessation of the armed conflict , and to convene a high-level planning group to prepare the envisaged peacekeeping operation . At the Lisbon Summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , the following principles were worked out for settling the armed conflict , recommended by the co-Chairmen of the OSCE Minsk Group and supported by all the OSCE member States , with the exception of Armenia : ( a ) Territorial integrity of the Armenian Republic and the Azerbaijani Republic ; ( b ) Legal status of Nagorny Karabakh as defined by an agreement based on self-determination and affording Nagorny Karabakh the highest degree of self-government within Azerbaijan ; ( c ) Guaranteed security for Nagorny Karabakh and its entire population , including mutual responsibility to ensure that all parties observe the provisions of the settlement . In 1999 , direct talks were instituted between the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan but were prevented from reaching any settlement of the conflict by the obstructive position taken by the Armenian side . Despite the categorical requirements of the United Nations Security Council and other organizations , Armenia continues to the present day to occupy areas of Azerbaijan and to build up its military potential in those areas . As stipulated by article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan , it is the paramount objective of the State to uphold human and civil rights and freedoms . Chapter III of the Constitution is devoted to fundamental human and civil rights and freedoms . The chapter comprises the following articles : A rapid process of legal and judicial reform has been conducted in Azerbaijan , embracing the adoption of , such instruments as the Criminal Code , the Code of Criminal Procedure , the Civil Code , the Code of Civil Procedure and the Penal Enforcement Code . In addition , statutes have been adopted on the Constitutional Court , on the courts and judges , on the procuratorial system , on the bar and the legal profession , on the police , and on other important matters . A totally reconfigured three-stage judicial system has been set in place . New judges have been selected on the basis of examinations and appointed to their posts . The country's penitentiary system has been brought into line with international standards . An act has been passed establishing an ombudsman's office and amendments made to the acts on the Central Electoral Commission and on the mass media . Appropriate changes have been made to the country's laws to take account of the views and recommendations of international organizations .

It contains chapters on offences against life and health ( chap . 18 , arts . 120-143 ) ; the freedom and dignity of the individual ( chap . 19 , arts . 144-148 ) ; the sexual inviolability and sexual freedom of the individual ( chap . 20 , arts . 149-153 ) ; constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms ( chap . 21 , arts . 154-169 ) ; and matters relating to juveniles and families ( chap . 22 , arts . 170-176 ) . The procedures for legal defence are also set forth in the Code of Criminal Procedure , the Penal Enforcement Code and the statutes on the consideration of applications by citizens , of 10 June 1997 ; on compensation for injury caused to individuals through the unlawful acts of the initial inquiry , pre-trial investigation , procuratorial and court authorities , of 29 December 1998 ; and on the submission of complaints to the courts regarding decisions and actions or omissions which infringe citizens' rights and freedoms , of 11 June 1999 . As stated in article 1 of the Unlawful Acts by the Initial Inquiry , Pre-trial Investigation , Procuratorial and Court Authorities ( Compensation to Individuals ) Act , compensation must be paid for any injury caused to any person in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan through the unlawful actions of the country's initial inquiry , pre-trial investigation , procuratorial or court authorities . The act contains a list of such unlawful actions . The Decision and Actions or Omissions Infringing Civil Rights and Freedoms ( Complaints to the Courts ) Act sets out rules for the lodging of challenges in the courts against decisions and actions or omissions which infringe the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Azerbaijani citizens established by the Constitution and by international treaties to which the Republic of Azerbaijan is a party and also contains provisions on judicial procedures to uphold the rights and freedoms of citizens . Pursuant to article 1 of the Decisions and Actions or Omissions Infringing Civil Rights and Freedoms ( Complaints to the Court ) Act , all citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan who consider that their rights and freedoms have been infringed as a result of decisions and actions or omissions by State authorities , local authorities , enterprises , institutions , organizations , voluntary associations or officials , shall be entitled to appeal to the courts . Aliens and stateless persons may appeal to the appropriate court in the manner prescribed by law , except as otherwise stipulated in international treaties to which the Republic of Azerbaijan is a party . A court ruling which has entered into force shall be binding on all State and local authorities , enterprises , institutions , organizations , voluntary associations and officials . In the event that a court ruling is not observed , the court shall adopt the appropriate measures , as prescribed by Azerbaijani legislation ( see article 7 of the Decisions and Actions or Omissions Infringing Civil Rights and Freedoms ( Complaints to the Courts ) Act . The Parties to Criminal Proceedings ( State Protection ) Act of 11 December 1998 sets out a system of measures to ensure the safety and social protection of victims and witnesses in criminal proceedings and of other parties to such proceedings . The safety measures defined by this act shall be applied whenever the safety of those persons can not be guaranteed by other means . The Republic of Azerbaijan is a party to all the major multilateral human rights treaties and regularly submits reports on its implementation of the provisions of those treaties to the appropriate treaty bodies . On 25 December 2001 , the Azerbaijani Parliament ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms . Under the Azerbaijani legal system , the provisions of international treaties may be cited in the courts and in other administrative bodies . Pursuant to paragraph 2 of article 12 of the Azerbaijani Constitution , the human and civil rights and freedoms enumerated in the Constitution shall be exercised in accordance with the international treaties to which the Republic of Azerbaijan is a party . Paragraph 2 of article 148 of the Constitution states that international treaties to which the Republic of Azerbaijan is a party form an integral part of the legislative system of the Republic of Azerbaijan . Article 151 of the Constitution stipulates that , in the event of conflict between the laws and regulations forming part of Azerbaijani law ( except for the Constitution and statutes adopted by referendum ) and the provisions of international treaties to which the Republic of Azerbaijan is a party , the international treaty provisions shall prevail . In accordance with the presidential decree of 22 February 1998 on measures to uphold human and civil rights and freedoms , the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the President's own executive office are responsible , together with the appropriate State authorities , for taking the necessary steps , in connection with the legal reforms currently under way , to ensure that the country's laws and regulations are fully consistent with international human rights standards . With a view to promoting and protecting human rights , the President of Azerbaijan has promulgated a number of decrees , including on a State human rights programme ; on additional measures to uphold the freedom of speech , opinion and information ; and on celebrations for the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . In February 1998 , on the recommendation of the President , the Azerbaijani Parliament abolished the death sentence in Azerbaijan . Under the International Treaties of the Republic of Azerbaijan ( Conclusion , Application and Denunciation Procedure ) Act , the Republic of Azerbaijan is required to comply faithfully with its international treaties in accordance with the rules of international law . Article 17 of that act stipulates that the Cabinet of Ministers , ministries , State committees , departments and other government agencies of the Republic of Azerbaijan with jurisdiction over the various issues governed by the country's international treaties shall be responsible for ensuring compliance with the obligations entered into under such treaties . Article 25 of the International Treaties of the Republic of Azerbaijan ( Conclusion , Application and Denunciation Procedure ) Act stipulates that international treaties of the Republic of Azerbaijan which have been ratified , approved or adopted in accordance with the provisions of the Act , or international treaties to which the Republic of Azerbaijan has acceded , shall be published , on application by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , in the Gazette of the Milli Meclis and in the official State newspaper of the Republic of Azerbaijan . International treaties of the Republic of Azerbaijan whose authentic texts have been drawn up in foreign languages shall be published in one of these languages together with an official translation into Azeri . Article 26 of the same act requires all international treaties of the Republic of Azerbaijan to be registered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the register of international treaties of the Republic of Azerbaijan .

The services of representatives of non-governmental organizations and independent experts are also enlisted in the preparation of these reports . The process of preparing these reports and their submission by government delegations to the treaty bodies of the United Nations is widely covered in the media . In 1998 , with the assistance of the Azerbaijani National Commission for UNESCO , a compilation of United Nations human rights treaties was published in the Azeri language . In 2001 , the Ministry of Justice issued a compilation of human rights instruments , including international treaties , presidential decrees and orders by the Ministry of Justice relating to human rights , the prevention of torture and respect for the rights of convicted persons in places of detention in accordance with international standards .

"Tips Today is National Boss's Day ; a secular holiday celebrated around the world on Oct. 16 each year . It reportedly began in 1958 when a woman named Patricia Bays Haroski registered the holiday with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because she wanted to designate a day for employees to show appreciation for their managers . Haroski chose Oct. 16 because it was her father's birthday , and she working for him at the time as a secretary for the State Farm Insurance Company in Illinois . In 1962 , four years after registering the holiday , the Illinois Governor officially proclaimed the day , which is now observed in the U.S. and countries such as Canada , Australia and India . Millions of appreciative workers will take full advantage of the day ; thanking their boss ' for their support , encouragement and guidance throughout the year . Others , however , have little to celebrate today . These are typically employees who have terrible relationships with their managers . If you fall into that second group of workers , National Boss's Day is the perfect opportunity to reflect on your employee-employer relationship , and think about ways to improve it . "" It 's very important to have a strong , or otherwise healthy relationship with your boss for a variety of reasons , "" says Teri Hockett , chief executive of What 's For Work ? , a career site for women . "" First , your boss has a tremendous amount of influence over workplace stress , whether real or perceived . They can make the workplace exciting and something to look forward to each day , or a place that you dread visiting . In short , your health is at stake , "" she says . "" Second , they typically hold the key to your advancement within the company , or sometimes outside as well . Without a good relationship , they may not speak highly of you or consider nominating you to other positions , departments or companies , regardless of your performance . And third , having a good relationship with your boss just makes sense . Work consumes most of your time usually , and having good relationships will make things more enjoyable and lead to opportunities . "" Joyce Maroney , senior director of customer experience and services marketing for Kronos , a Mass. - based workforce management software and services company , says the boss-employee relationship is much like others we need to manage in our lives . "" We get out of them what we put into them – as long as both parties are committed to the relationship , "" she says . "" If both parties are n't clear in communicating their expectations and giving feedback when expectations are n't met , little issues can snowball to the point the relationship is no longer viable . "" Maroney says a recent Kronos survey revealed that 69 % of employees believe their managers set a good example in the way they behave and 92 % of those employees also believe their managers adhere to those values on a regular basis . "" But setting a good example for behavior does n't always translate into a strong relationship . Employees might not get the direct and constructive performance feedback they need to elevate their career – or the boss is n't all that invested so he or she does n't push the team to consistently achieve and grow . "" Sandy Mazur , a division president at Spherion , a recruiting and staffing firm , agrees . "" In order to grow , learn and advance in their careers , employees need to be on the same page with their supervisors about their goals , objectives and career path , "" she says . "" And employees should start this dialogue so that they can open the lines of communication with their supervisor and engage them in this process . "" According to a recent Spherion "" Emerging Workforce "" study , most workers rate their relationship with their supervisor as good , great or excellent ( 84 % ) . "" However , for the small amount of people that rate their relationship as weak , it could be related to trust . Strong relationships are based on trust from both parties , and it takes an open line of communication from both the employee and the supervisor to make that happen . "" Other reasons some employees have such weak relationships with their boss ? Andy Teach , a corporate veteran and author of From Graduation to Corporation , says sometimes it 's simply due to the "" very nature of the boss-employee dynamic . "" "" If an employee has someone over them who is constantly telling them what to do and in many instances , how to do it , this can easily cause friction and resentment , "" he says . "" An employee is always being held accountable by their supervisor and this just adds stress to the employee 's already stressful work day . In addition , there are many employees who are jealous of their boss and perhaps feel that they , not the boss , should be the one in charge . Again , this causes resentment toward the one person at work who has the most control over your career . "" But Teach says it 's absolutely imperative to have a great work relationship with your boss "" because they control your destiny . "" "" You do n't have to love your boss but you need to be able to work well with them . One of the main reasons employees leave their job is because of their boss . A troubled relationship with your boss can negatively affect your morale , your productivity , your happiness , and of course , your career . A positive relationship can improve your morale , productivity and happiness which could lead to more career success in the form of promotions , raises and higher self-esteem . "" Maroney says a "" strong relationship "" may mean different things to different people , but what she has seen again and again is that "" it 's important to manage your relationship with your boss if you expect to prosper in a job . "" Here 's how to strengthen your relationship with your boss : Put yourself in your boss's shoes . Figure out the challenges your boss will encounter that day and be prepared to offer solutions , Mazur suggests . "" Anticipate the questions that your supervisor may ask about your work or a project and have thoughtful answers or next steps for them to take . Thinking ahead can really show that you 're an invaluable team member . "" Teach says it 's easy to be resentful of your boss , especially if they treat you a certain way , "" but they have a job to do , just like you , "" he explains . "" There 's a lot about their job that you do n't know about or see , so do n't assume that they 're out to get you , "" he adds . "" Sometimes they act a certain way for a reason – perhaps their boss is putting a lot of pressure on them – so try to be understanding . "" Show value . "" They hired you for a reason , so make sure that you 're adding value to the organization and / or position , "" Hockett says . "" Bosses want employees not only to agree with them , but also be willing to speak up about the realities and challenges in the business that need to be addressed . Be the person that speaks with facts , confidence and reasonable suggestions that produce results . This builds your boss's confidence in you . "" How did you choose your profession ? Did you pick a job that you thought would be easy ? Or lucrative ? Or glamorous ? Or , did you pursue a career related to your interests and hobbies ? Chances are , you did n't base your decision on the latter – but you probably should have . Why ? Hobbies are the things you choose to do ; activities that you 're probably good at and enjoy doing , and these personal expressions "" will give us unedited clues as to our real desires and interests , "" says Joyce K. Reynolds , an expert business coach . She says looking for career clues in one's choice of hobbies , interests and vocational activities will provide the most fruitful direction for highly successful career choices . "" In fact , the earlier we are able to observe our personal tastes as they show up in hobbies and outside activities , the more powerful a lead these things will provide in steering us to meaningful professional and career choices . "" Career coach Phyllis Mufson agrees . "" A hobby you really enjoy can be an important part of choosing a career because your hobby is a window into what you love and value and do most naturally , which are all important components of a career where you 'll flourish . "" While there can be tremendous joy in earning income from doing something that you might happily do for free , there are also practical benefits . "" It can be easier to segue into a hobby-related career since you may already have many of the skills , experiences and personal connections needed for success , "" says Nancy Collamer , a career coach at MyLifestyleCareer.com . But you need to spend time seriously evaluating whether turning your hobby into your work is a good idea , she adds . "" Sometimes it 's best to leave the two as separate and distinct parts of your life . "" Here are a few ways to monetize a hobby : Teach others to do what you love . Teach piano lessons , offer cooking classes , or teach another language , if those are your passions . You can do this by teaching through a college or continuing education program , by creating your own classes , or by creating your own webinars or tele-seminar series online , Collamer says . Sell / import / invent / craft a product or accessory for enthusiasts in your hobby . For example , if you are a wine enthusiast , you might import hand-blown wine glasses from a different country , or invent a unique wine refrigeration device , or develop a line of fun wine-themed T-shirts . "" Hobbyists tend to be very enthusiastic , passionate and willing to spend money on items related to their hobby , "" Collamer says . "" Just think of what baseball enthusiasts are willing to pay for World Series tickets . "" Teach the business of the hobby . "" I actually talk about this in my book ( Second-Act Careers : 50 + Ways to Profit From Your Passions During Semi-Retirement ) , using an example of a man who used to work for Microsoft in marketing , but his hobby was magic , and now he teaches marketing to magicians , "" Collamer says . So let 's say your background is in publishing , but you love cooking , you could specialize in teaching people in the food industry how to get their cookbooks published . "" I have another example in my book of a woman who teaches people how to make a living importing goods from Ecuador , for people who love to travel and / or shop . "" Speak or write about your hobby . Hobby related how-to topics , historical perspectives , and compelling stories , are all of interest to enthusiasts , Collamer says . And you could get paid to do it . Create a tour or performance series around what you love . "" The other day I met a woman who bills herself as a ' Founding Fathers Fanatic ' and she performs at schools , in character , to teach students about the Founding Fathers , "" Collamer says . "" Another example of this is Tony Mula , who turned his love of pizza and Brooklyn into the highly successful ' A Slice of Brooklyn ' pizza tours , "" she adds . "" I also know of a bike enthusiast who runs bike tours in California . "" Appraise , repair or fix items related to what you love . Most hobbies have "" stuff "" connected to them , and sometimes , that stuff needs to be fixed by a skilled and knowledgeable person . "" You could fix computers , appraise collectibles , repair bicycles , source missing parts for highly unusual items , and so on , "" Collamer says . "" The next time you find yourself confused as to how to generate income from your hobbies , search out the most successful entrepreneurs in your area of interest and study their business models and revenue streams , "" Collamer suggests . "" Ask yourself : Is their income coming from consulting services , videos , accessories , events , classes or product sales ? What is their mix of products and services ? What is their pricing strategy ? "" In doing this , you 'll discover proven models for monetizing your hobbies , as well as helpful information about how to price your own services and products . Mufson , who has interests outside of career coaching , says she managed to turn a hobby into a lucrative part-time gig . "" I personally turned my hobby of creating gemstone jewelry into a side-line business , "" she explains . "" Jewelry making is an expensive hobby and early on I decided to make it pay for itself . Since then I have developed two online stores and a relationship with a jewelry gallery that sells most of my work . "" Not everyone is going to wind up a star by following a well-loved hobby into a professional setting , Reynolds says . "" We ca n't all be Olympic skaters , NBA top scorers or real estate moguls . However , it can be taken as a promise that , if we follow the lines and design of our natural interests and loves , we will give ourselves the very best chance to grow into the most successful human beings we can be . It will also ensure that we have more days we love because we 're doing the things that most interest us , nourish us , and give us expression , "" she concludes . There are a few problems with the Tourism Authority of Thailand 4-page brochure mainly that they neglected to also publish this document in the Thai language since most of the offenses listed are committed by Thais and not by foreigners . The problem with the Tourism Authority of Thailand brochure for Chinese and Western tourists is that it has errors , assumes Thailand is Singapore , and only expects tourists to obey the rules – not local Thais . Right off the bat , the Tourism Authority of Thailand pamphlet tells us that smoking is allowed in all of Thailand's International Airports . The International Airports in Thailand have designated smoking areas – outside . At Suvarnabhumi International Airport in Bangkok , one has to cross the street and go to a designated area or face a 2,000 baht fine . I guess the Tourism Authority of Thailand is trying to help the cigarette-butt police increase their daily take . What the Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to mention is that if you get into a confrontation with a Thai , he will most likely get 10 of his buddies to come and beat the shit out of you . Failing that , he will pull a gun and shoot you . Tourism Authority of Thailand Counterfeits The Tourism Authority of Thailand also does n't tell you that you can buy your pornographic materials right out in the open on Sukhumvit Road . Dildos , XXX videos , and fake / real Viagra are readily available . All sorts of copyright material are also available . Tourism Authority of Thailand Loud Yes , Thais are soft-spoken except when they are drunk . They can also be quite noisy if handed a microphone especially when butchering karaoke songs . Tourism Authority of Thailand Proper Attire The Tourism Authority of Thailand also fails to point out , like Tom at Isaan-Live has done numerous times , that the biggest violators are Thai women . Tourism Authority of Thailand Spitting Yes , it is disgusting . For some reason the Tourism Authority of Thailand thinks this is Singapore where people get caned for spitting . But , no this is Thailand where at times it seems like the national pastime is spitting – and no one gets caned . Tourism Authority of Thailand Driving Safety I saved the best for last . The Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to mention that Thais are some of the worst drivers in the world , traffic laws are not followed , and the Thai Police selectively enforce laws . But , maybe since Chiang Mai targets foreign drivers these silly rules should be followed by tourists – after all – they are not followed by most Thais . Let 's take a look at them one by one : Drive safely in Thailand and strictly follow all traffic regulations . Yes , do n't do like Thai drivers and disobey every driving rule there is . Thailand adopts left-hand drive system . Always keep to the left lane when driving in Thailand . Actually , it should be that slower moving traffic stick to the left lane and only pass on the right . The Tourism Authority of Thailand does n't tell you that you can drive like a Thai and cross double yellow lines , pass on a hill , and drive at any speed you want . Always beware of bicycles and motorbikes as there are many on the roads . The Tourism Authority of Thailand fails to warn foreigners that Thais like to drive their motorcycles on the wrong side of the road and also like to drive on the sidewalks / footpaths . To prevent accidents , do not stop your car abruptly in the middle of a road for any reason . Unless you are Thai – then it is OK . If you are Thai , you can also stop in front of 7-11 or an ATM machine and block one lane of traffic as long as you put on one turn signal indicator . Please study the directions before each journey to make sure you know your way . And , do n't use any guidebooks from the Tourism Authority of Thailand unless you plan on getting lost . Always stop at zebra crossings to allow all pedestrians to cross the road first . The Tourism Authority of Thailand should warn people that zebra crossings / pedestrian crossing sare simply lines painted on the road that are ignored by all Thai drivers . If you stop for pedestrians in the crossing , be prepared to be rammed from the back . The rest of the list from the Tourism Authority of Thailand only pertain to those that bring vehicles into Thailand from foreign countries so it is of no value at all for Chinese / Western tourists and will most likely just confuse people . This just goes to show that the Tourism Authority of Thailand is clueless when it comes to foreign tourists and needs to focus some of its energy on cleaning up Thailand or tourists will stop visiting . One of the most important hiring criteria for many companies is the ability to work as a team player – yet , so many of us have colleagues who do n't play well with others . "" If you have one bad apple in the bunch , it can really hurt the morale and enthusiasm of an entire department , "" says Andy Teach , author of From Graduation to Corporation , and host of the YouTube channel FromGradToCorp . "" A department , or company , that works well together , has the most success together . When you enjoy working with your colleagues and look forward to interacting with them , everyone benefits . "" Working with other team members whom you have a great work relationship with can actually make work fun , he says . "" Morale is high , which leads to better productivity , which leads to better results . "" Skip Weisman , a leadership and workplace communication expert , agrees . "" A high-morale work environment will always produce more than a low-morale work environment . "" When people care about the people they work with , things get done faster , he says . "" People will go the extra mile ; they will take ownership of a job , a decision or problem and work through it without feeling like they have to go up the chain to get things done . "" Another benefit of colleagues working well together : Information flows more freely , says David Parnell , a legal consultant , communication coach and author . "" In addition , the group 's well being and success become more of a priority ; patience , generosity and a gravitation toward interaction grows ; and good moods and dynamic information beget better moods and even more dynamic information , "" he says . "" All of this conspires to create a more balanced , functional , aggressive and successful company . "" So , what happens when colleagues do n't work well together ? Parnell says time and cognitive bandwidth is wasted "" exercising restraint , measuring words and otherwise forcing hands to play nicely in the sandbox . "" The outcome is shoddy workmanship , pushed or missed deadlines and severe lacerations to the company culture or your group's sub-culture . Deborah Shane , a career author , writer , speaker and professional branding and social media marketing strategist , adds that a bad workplace relationship creates negative energy , which can affect everyone on the team , as well as customers or clients . It can also cause employee turnover , which "" interrupts building and creating a strong , unified team . "" Finally , she says , "" conflict fosters cliques and factions within a team that always works against it . "" Make teamwork a priority by making it part of the performance management system . This begins with performance expectations when someone joins the organization , Weisman says . "" I was speaking with a prospective client last summer who was complaining about this very thing – that their people were not working well together – so I asked her , ' Well , do you assess their contribution to teamwork as part of your annual performance review process ? ' She looked at me like a deer in headlights and responded as if it was a master stroke of genius . "" If you do n't measure it and give people the expectation at the very beginning of their role with the organization , it will not be seen as priority . Pinpoint the issue . "" Explore your feelings and behavior toward your colleagues , "" says Parnell . "" Social and professional relationships are inextricably symbiotic and interactive , and much of the communication that occurs is both subconscious and reactive . "" If your colleagues seem to be difficult , they may actually be reacting to the signals you are giving off – whether consciously or unconsciously . While this might be a bitter pill to swallow , you may be the very root of the problem and the first step toward recovery is discovering this . Think you deserve a bigger paycheck ? Want to ask for a raise but not sure you 'll get one ? Plenty of employees are finding themselves in this predicament , because many recession-wary companies that stopped handing out raises during the economic downturn are still hesitant to open their wallets today . But career experts say that despite all the penny-pinching , a salary hike is n't necessarily out of the question – so you might as well ask . "" Clearly most companies today are not looking for opportunities to hand out money , "" says Lynn Taylor , a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant ; How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job . "" During the boom era of the late '90s when talent was scarce and retention was top of mind , nearly the opposite was true . While the corporate landscape is different now , you should n't sit idly and feel dissatisfied in silence . If you have supportive evidence your salary is at sub-market levels , you should speak up . "" She says it is possible to get a raise , even in an environment where money is n't exactly falling from trees . "" Your organization has invested time and money in you . Savvy bosses understand that unhappy and underpaid employees are under-performing employees , which helps no one . It 's a drain on their time to have to re-hire and train a replacement that fits the corporate culture . So if you have a legitimate request , you do have a certain amount of leverage . "" Connie Thanasoulis-Cerrachio , a career expert and co-founder of SixFigureStart , a career coaching firm , agrees . "" I think it 's always a good idea to ask for a raise , even when employers are not handing them out , "" she says . "" But only when that discussion is tied to performance . "" Employees should keep careful records of how their actions helped the bottom line of their company , or helped other team members improve the bottom line of the company , she suggests . "" No one is going to hold your hand and remind you of the great things you did all year , "" she adds , so keep track and share them with your manager at the appropriate time . Asking for a pay raise is a delicate conversation and something you should not do without careful planning , says Dr. Katharine Brooks , executive director of the office of personal and career development at Wake Forest University and author of You Majored in What ? Mapping Your Path from Chaos to Career . "" Being prepared can help you overcome your hesitation . "" Aside from keeping track of your accomplishments and contributions , you can plan by thinking about things like timing . "" This is key , "" Brooks says . "" If others are being laid off , or there has been a cutback in revenues to the organization , that is generally not the time to ask for a raise . Wait for things to settle , then assess the situation . Perhaps you are now doing the work of two former workers , or you have brought in more revenue than in previous years . Wait until you can approach from a positive rather than negative stance . "" Know your value . Do the proper research to figure out what you 're worth , even if it means going on interviews or using resources like Getraised.com , Payscale.com , or Glassdoor.com , says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio . If you find out you 're underpaid , you can use that to negotiate an increase . "" Look at salary surveys , cost-of-living comparisons , and rates of compensation within your organization , if possible , "" Brooks says . "" If you are aware that colleagues are earning more than you , tread carefully . You do n't want to put others in a negative light or violate a corporate written or unwritten rule about knowing what others earn . Simply present what the field generally pays , and why you believe your performance is at the top of your field . "" Know the number . Once you do the research , figure out what you think is a fair amount of money to ask for , says Thanasoulis-Cerrachio . "" Have that number in your head when you ask for a raise . "" Schedule a meeting . Find a time that works best for you and your boss , Thanasoulis-Cerrachio says . Taylor adds , "" Give your boss a head 's up that you want to chat about your career growth so that you both have ample time . "" Practice salary negotiations . This can be a difficult or awkward conversation . Practice with a friend who can be a tough negotiator , Thanasoulis-Cerrachio says . We all have our moments of "" multitask overload "" – especially managers . But working with a perpetually disorganized boss can be exasperating and even detrimental to your workplace productivity . "" You may feel like you 're spinning your wheels , "" says Lynn Taylor , a national workplace expert and author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant ; How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job . "" There can be many false starts if your boss has n't thought through a project or the resources required for it ; if he has n't set priorities well ; or if he ca n't get back to you because everything appears to be in disarray . And if you follow orders based on a disorganized initiative , a chaotic domino effect can occur within your department . "" This work style can negatively affect your sense of accomplishment and performance , she adds . "" And it can bring down an entire team . "" Sara Sutton Fell , CEO and founder of FlexJobs , agrees . "" It can be extremely frustrating to deal with a disorganized boss , because their disorganization often trickles ( or even pours ) down on you . It can hurt team morale , and it reflects poorly on everyone . "" When the boss is disorganized , it can lead to partial project requests , misinformation , missed or wrong deadlines and "" general messiness , "" she says . "" All of those can cause balls to be dropped , and then ensuing stress and rush to pick them back up again . "" Katharine Brooks , executive director of the office of personal and career development at Wake Forest University and author of You Majored in What ? Mapping Your Path from Chaos to Career , says the word "" disorganized "" can mean several things . "" It could be a failure to see the big picture and approach issues strategically ; difficulty remembering important deadlines , meetings , projects , etc. ; or failure to set goals and prioritize what is important for the office . "" Productivity coach Casey Moore concurs . She says in the workplace , "" disorganization "" takes many forms . One , she says , is what she calls "" the searcher . "" "" This supervisor ca n't find the objects or information she needs when she needs them . She frequently wastes time looking for keys , emails , digital files , etc. – and she wastes money replacing lost items and wastes energy ( and more time ) re-creating documents or other work products . She usually has a cluttered desk and email inbox , "" explains Moore , the author of Stop Organizing , Start Producing . "" You and your colleagues will likely be dragged into time-consuming searches or scrambles to re-do or replace what is n't found . You may have to exercise caution about what you give your supervisor because it may be lost and / or forgotten . "" "" The improviser "" is another type of disorganized boss . This supervisor does n't plan ahead . He may be adept at reacting and improvising on the spot , but eventually you realizes he 's covering his tracks , not blazing a trail , Moore says . "" He requires his team to reinvent the wheel over and over because there 's no time to fine-tune processes when you 're always behind the curve . "" If this is your boss , you and your colleagues likely perform too many fire drills : rushing to meet deadlines , struggling to fix easily-preventable mistakes , and missing out on opportunities that require a modicum of foresight . Moore says the third type of disorganized supervisor is "" the constrictor . "" This boss does n't delegate , she says . "" Her reasons vary from altruist ( ' protecting ' her team ) to arrogant ( only she can do it ' right ' ) ; from fearful ( of letting go ) to flummoxed ( unable to identify exactly how others could help ) . The result , however , is always the same : a bottleneck that slows everyone . "" This type of boss's subordinates probably feel frustrated by her unresponsiveness , the lack of challenging goals and the subtle implication that she does n't think you they handle the work , Moore adds . Do you have a coworker who thinks he knows everything ? He believes he 's the go-to person ; the one with the special connections and authority . He acts as though he 's been everywhere and has experienced everything . If there 's a problem , he has the solution ; if there 's a question , he has the answer . He is n't open to new ideas or collaborating – and he has strong opinions , which he delivers in an obnoxious manner . Chances are , you 've never , ever heard him utter the words "" I do n't know . "" "" They tend to monopolize conversations , dismiss input from others and make decisions without first considering all the facts , "" she says . "" A ' my way or the highway ' attitude often leads to unhappy coworkers , disgruntled clients , and an unhappy work environment . "" Andrew G. Rosen , founder and editor of career advice blog Jobacle.com , says it can be extremely difficult to work with a know-it-all because "" they are generally poor listeners , often thinking about what they are going to say next rather than hear what you are saying . Their mindset makes it hard to get through to them that their idea or solution might not be the best one . They have often already formed an opinion and will not be swayed . "" Michael Kerr , an international business speaker , president of Humor at Work , and author of The Humor Advantage : Why Some Businesses are Laughing all the Way to the Bank ( Dec. 2013 ) , agrees . "" Know-it-alls can be extremely frustrating to work with for a number of reasons , "" he says . "" One , they tend to speak more than they listen , so people can be left with the feeling that their opinions or ideas have n't been given a proper hearing . They can often be close-minded as well – which means they can become a severe impediment to the creative process by blocking any idea other than their own . They simply know an idea either will or wo n't work . Some know-it-alls can come across as opinionated , aggressive , brusque and even loud – all traits that wo n't win over a lot of people at the office – and in fact can be easily construed as bullying behavior . "" Here are eight tips for dealing with a know-it-all coworker : 1 . Be empathetic . This coworker may irritate you – but remember that his or her know-it-all attitude is probably stemming from a confidence issue or some deeper personal issue , Rosen says . "" Rather than get angry , allow yourself to be empathetic . "" 2 . Pick your battles . "" Dealing with a know-it-all can be exhausting and there are times when your best response is to ignore their ' helpful ' hints as much as possible , "" Collamer says . "" Deflect their comments with a simple , ' Thanks for that suggestion ' instead of engaging them in an ongoing conversation . "" 3 . Lead by example . "" A boss or manager , especially , needs to model the behavior that in many circumstances it 's not only okay to not know everything , it 's encouraged , "" Kerr says . "" Saying ' I do n't know , but let 's find some answers or get some great ideas ' demonstrates that you are flexible and open to other opinions . Saying ' I do n't know , ' can also build trust by demonstrating openness , vulnerability and honesty . "" 4 . Be armed with your own facts . If you are delivering a presentation , selling an idea or heading into a meeting , be confident in your own facts , Kerr says . "" Double check your sources and verify the facts . The more armed you are with knowledge , the less chance the know-it-all has to interject or one up you . "" When in meetings , stick to an agenda ( passed around ahead of time ) that provides a set amount of time for each person to speak , Collamer adds . "" Come prepared with facts and statistics in writing , so in the event ' Mr. Know-it-all ' does n't let you get a word in edgewise , you have something in writing to share with the team . The better prepared you are , the less room there will be for the know-it-all to commandeer the discussion . "" "" Although it 's highly tempting to use sarcasm with a know-it-all , this will undoubtedly backfire . Instead , take a deep breath , smile and do your best Johnny Carson impersonation , ' I did not know that . That is weird , wild stuff . ' Laugh it off by reminding yourself that often their behavior is harmless and they do n't really mean anything by it . A friendly , ' Okay , I want you on my Trivial Pursuit team ' can disarm a potentially tense situation . "" 6 . Ask probing questions . Be respectful , but ask detailed question to peel back the layers of a know-it-all's stance , Kerr suggests . "" Ask why they believe something to be true or where they found their sources , "" he says . "" Asking pointed questions on specific details can teach a know-it-all over time that they need to have their facts in order before speaking out . "" 7 . Take the person aside and offer constructive feedback on their behavior . "" Recognize that it 's possible that Ms. Know-it-all may be clueless about the impact of her behavior on others , "" Collamer says . "" If you suspect that 's the case , consider gently pointing this out during a private discussion away from the office . "" Kerr adds : "" Although this can be tricky , if you do it in a respectful way it can help . Keep in mind that many know-it-alls may be highly insecure , so stroke their ego , flatter them on their range of knowledge , but caution them as to how their communication style may be coming across to other people . "" Remind them how important it is for less confident people than themselves to be able to speak up . 8 . Avoid involving your boss unless the know-it-all is truly threatening your success . "" If that becomes necessary , maintain a positive tone and instead of complaining about the person , focus on what you 're willing to do to make sure the work is done well , "" says Isa Adney , author of How to Get a Job Without a Resume and the blog firstjoboutofcollege.com . Collamer agrees . "" If the situation really becomes unbearable , talk it over with your boss and let him or her know how the know-it-all's behavior is impacting the team and work environment . "" Any new entrepreneur can become quickly overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork involved in running a business . A business owner has to be concerned about record-keeping requirements for tax purposes , client contact notes , marketing schedules , and billing , while still trying to meet the day-to-day needs of running a business . Try to be as paper-free as possible . This saves money and storage costs , and does n't tie you down to a desk . One advantage of being new is that you can start from the beginning with everything . It is difficult to try to get organized once your business is established . Take some time to consider some online options that will cut down on paperwork and get your office on track right from the very start . Here are five tips that can help : Dropbox : This free online service lets you bring your photos , documents , and videos anywhere and share them easily . Just start an account to install the Dropbox application on your computer . Then you simply create and share folders to exchange information with other people . Also use Dropbox to store your own files so they are available wherever you go . Join . me : Join . me offers free screen sharing and online meetings . Share your computer screen to go over any documents when you have telephone appointments with clients . Money Issues : Being in business requires you to become a good money manager . You must keep your financial commitments and be tenacious about accounts receivable . Whenever possible , have clients pay for as much work upfront as possible . If any amount is due , use scheduling reminders to send a reminder invoice . As your business grows , you might begin using QuickBooks or PayPal to help in collecting and sending money . Authorize . Net is another online payment solution , where clients receive a link via email and access the site to pay by credit or debit card . Tax Issues : Depending on your business you could be responsible for federal and state income tax , social security payments , sales tax , and other tax responsibilities . Consult a local accountant , tax advisor , tax authority , or Small Business Administration office to find out what taxes you are responsible for as a small business owner . A Little Now Saves A Lot Later It 's never too early for high school students to start checking out colleges on their list of potential schools . A campus tour is not only a great way for students to find places they love , but also to cross off those on their list that may not be the right fit . A college may look great in a brochure or say all the right things on its website , but the true test of fit often comes from a personal visit . Of course , several things can make or break a college tour . For example , students who visit during the summer or over breaks may not have the same experience as those who attend information sessions and tours during the fall or spring semesters . To ensure students have a successful college tour , I suggest the following tips . 1 . Explore Online Before students head to any campus , it 's a good idea to do a little reconnaissance . Students should check the college's website to verify the school offers the degree programs they may be interested in , as well as study abroad or research opportunities ( if desired ) . Students may want to browse the student activities page and see what clubs , organizations and groups may be present on campus , as well . It 's not a bad idea to check if any events ( sporting , concert , etc. ) will be held during the tour date , as there could be issues with parking or areas of the campus that are inaccessible at that time . Students should definitely familiarize themselves with the admissions and financial aid pages , too . After carefully reviewing the college's website , students should write down any questions they might have and bring these with them during the tour . 2 . Make Appointments Although some schools may have informal , walk-in tours available , most of the larger schools will require an appointment for students to participate in an admissions session and / or campus tour . This means students will need to go online or call weeks ( or even months ) in advance to secure their spot . Depending on the time of year , some schools may even limit the number of high school underclassmen allowed , saving those precious spaces for graduating seniors who will be attending next fall . Seniors should not only participate in an admissions session and tour , but also consider scheduling an interview with an admissions counselor , and possibly meeting with the department chairs or professors within their chosen degree field . Juniors , who tour during the spring or summer before senior year , should also consider going through the interview process . 3 . Roam Freely Campus tours are a great way to get a feel for a school , but students should remember that tours are geared to show them the best the college has to offer . To see what a college may be like on an average day , students should opt to roam on their own for a few hours before or after their tour . It 's a good idea for them to have a meal at the cafeteria ( they 'll be eating there quite a lot , if accepted ) , sit in on a class ( big and small ) , or chat up some students that are hanging out on campus . If possible , students should also spend some time exploring the surrounding community , or consider participating in an overnight stay , to see if it the college is a good match . It 's helpful if students bring along a campus scorecard to keep track of things they like ( or dislike ) during their tours , as campuses can start to blend together after a few visits . Students should pay attention to various things , such as dorm room sizes and options , typical class size , how many students stay after their first year and how many graduate on time , as well as other things that may play a role in their decision to apply . Once students have narrowed their lists , sent in their college applications , and received their acceptance letters , a second trip may be needed to help them make a final decision . A picture may speak a thousand words , but a campus visit is the best way for students to see themselves in that picture .",2,1
"Atheism vs. Religion: can't we have a sensible debate? I am posting this as a reaction to a few debates I got involved in recently, including one earlier today. My thoughts on these issues are still rather at a very early stage of development (and I daresay it shows), but it's an issue that's been bugging me for a while -- that, and I promised Zadok Day that I'd turn my arguments into a blog post.   [Edited to add: Zadok Day has now also written a blog post on this topic] I keep coming across atheists who not only argue vigorously against religion but also like to maintain that religion is responsible for most evils in this world, has had no positive consequences whatsoever and is generally hateful and bigoted. Moreover, such people seem to be awfully easily offended by anything that even faintly reminds them of the presence of religion anywhere in public life, and some would clearly like to see nothing less than removing religion from the planet altogether. For me the most staggering and infuriating thing about such discussions is the single-minded, dogmatic zeal with which such opinions are being presented. I can only call it a fundamentalist mindset, and it worries me deeply, since I generally consider fundamentalism as destructive. To put this argument in context, let me point out that I am a practicing Roman Catholic, but I'd also describe myself as very liberal about religion, society and life in general. As so many people who consider themselves religious, I am very happy not to fit a number of the usual stereotypes. When I come across yet another one of those atheism-against-religion discussions, I don't feel victimised, but I am worried about increasing polarisation, and frankly, the dumbing down of the discussion: I blame it on the Christian Right in the US and on people like Dawkins and Hitchens trying to reply in kind. If you have a discussion where both sides claim that they are the persecuted minority whose grievances ought to get priority you are in trouble -- yet that's exactly where we are rapidly going in this debate. In the end, I can't stand fundamentalists on both sides, and I get on with people of various religious views and none as long as they are willing to listen to other people's arguments and don't use their (non-)religious views to try to 'prove' their own self-importance and superiority to other people -- or as long as they are not aggressive and condescending in trying to convert others to 'their side'. When it comes to the most zealous atheists I am often shocked about the apparently wilful ignorance and very shallow, stereotypical views of religion which often underlie their arguments: unfortunately, Richard Dawkins is a prime offender in this respect. In essence, the argument is often along the lines of: 'if you are a Christian you obviously conform to stereotypes X, Y and Z'; and usually these stereotypes are not at all compatible with how religion (at least Christianity) is practiced in most parts of western Europe. For example, if you base your ideas of Christians on Richard Dawkins's pronouncements, you might be surprised to hear that most Christians in western Europe have absolutely no problem with thinking that the natural world has taken its shape via the fascinating mechanism of evolution. What we get is people like Dawkins arguing against the kind of Christianity that is practiced in some parts of the USA -- without much  (or any) acknowledgement of the sheer range of beliefs and practices that exist besides this rather extreme (if vocal) variant. This statement (spotted during discussion today) seems typical for the kind of attitude I am describing: It is the notion that those who follow religions on cherry pick from religious texts that annoy me. ""Oh the bible teaches me to forgive"". So how about the bit about God promoting genocide? ""Well, umm..we all inerpret it differently"". That was a real conversation with a real christian that I had. Just how unacceptable and annoying is it that somebody who claims to be a Christian isn't willing to fit completely with the 'evil bigot' stereotype? A Christian willing to think about interpreting the Bible and to prioritise tolerance! Get the thought police! The problem is that religion is a complex historical and sociological phenomenon. This seems to be complete anathema to some people who participate in such debates. Here is a typical statement: It is impossible for an atheist to believe that morality comes from anywhere other than humanity itself. Morality belongs to human beings not religions not gods. If you say that I hold Christian values you are imposing your religious beliefs on to me. I reject Christianity's claim on them! While there might not be any scientific evidence for the existence of a god, it's hard to claim that there is no evidence for the existence and impact of religion as an anthropological phenomenon. In fact, I would say that the claim made above leaves some pretty basic logic behind. If you don't believe in God then surely you must assume that the phenomenon of religion is clearly a human invention, so what is the problem? For somebody who considers history in a rational manner, any Christian values obviously come 'from humanity itself', and it's hard to deny that a part of our society's values were, during the last nineteen centuries or so, shaped by this particular philosophical system. The statement above seems to suggest that the person who made it  simply refuses to accept that any form of culture, history and society they disapprove of may have influenced whatever values they hold. When suspicion of religion goes so far that it leads to a complete rejection of some pretty basic facts of cultural history as it stands, that strikes me as the kind of fundamentalist mindset which prioritises ideology (or belief) over rational thinking. Of course, this kind of statement tends to come from people who pride themselves in basing all their values and ideas on pure rationalism. In my book, overlooking the facts of history because it doesn't fit one's wishful thinking isn't exactly rational. I am even more worried about arguments along the lines of 'religion is generally evil and has only ever brought bad consequences'. Making arguments like this about complex sociological phenomena is simply beneath intelligent discourse -- how is that better than saying all 'gay people are evil', or various other things some religious people get spectacularly and dogmatically wrong? And the reaction to any counter-argument is often just as the worst of religious fundamentalists would react, namely along the lines of 'I am right and you are wrong, because my ideology is by definition rational and superior, so there'. It's a mindset that exists in relation to any kind of big idea (and 'there is no god' is a big idea)- and it's really worrying if at a time when religious fundamentalism is increasingly recognised as something we need to fight, it's the atheists, of all people, who inject more of that kind of rigid mindset into the discussion. You'd have hoped that those who criticise the excesses of fundamentalist beliefs would try their best not to operate in the exact same way in order to push their own ideas -- but apparently it doesn't work like that. Fire, apparently, is to be fought with more fire.  Thanks for nothing, Richard Dawkins. Of course, this kind of argument is refuted time and time again with a kind of arrogance which simply refuses to accept that atheists might be susceptible to this kind of problem - here is another handy snippet spotted just a few hours ago: We don't want to be told that our rejection of religion is itself a quasi-religious belief. If people stopped doing that, stopped trying to impose religion on us, there would be far less to object to. Well, how else should one describe it? In a debate where argument stands against argument, atheism represents an alternative belief system just as all the other viewpoints represented by other participants. A 'belief system' does not have to involve gods, and can be based on rational or irrational arguments. In the end, what matters is how the proponents of that way of thinking present their arguments. Do they shove them down the throats of other people? Do they use their beliefs to make themselves feel superior? Do they let their ideas trump rational argument or evidence? Do they actually use proper arguments? People who sum up religion with statements like 'I laugh at people who believe in fairies' are no less obnoxious than people who say 'you'll go to hell because you don't believe in God in exactly the way I tell you to'. I have nothing against atheism, which strikes me as a honest way of reacting to a rational world, but I am worried about a debate which increasingly sees entrenched positions and an arrogant unwillingness to investigate contexts, nuances and history. My big worry is that if Richard Dawkins and his followers continue in this vein they will produce the kind of irrational entrenched opposition they are currently merely postulating for places like the UK and Europe. Perhaps they really crave a world polarised between atheists and religious people, a world where we get black and white instead of many shades of grey  -- but I certainly don't want to see that happening. We need less polarisation, not more. 15 Responses to Atheism vs. Religion: can't we have a sensible debate? This post seems to be one of those ""Cardboard Cut out"" target things. a collection of ""some people say"" things, clearly not understood and but "" I can get my teeth into them so they'll do for my purpose. Like God, they can't be contradicted because they are either mistaken and a waste of time contradicting, or only held by a few, often very few, people. A non argument argued for the sake of having and argument! Thanks for a stimulating and well thought-through blog Maria. One thing that I have noticed about the fundamentalists (both atheist and religious) is how little good they seem to do and how little they show signs of caring about the most oppressed and needy in the world. Their dominant purpose in life seems to be to attack their opposite numbers, rather than to try to make the world a better place. ""Somebody as intelligent as Jesus would have been an atheist if he had known what we know...."" So there's a specific example of someone patronising people of faith -- only stupid people believe in God. I don't believe in God(s), but I'm aware that about 95% of the planet does, and to hold yourself as cleverer than several billion people because hey, you've worked it all out and they haven't, is an act of such supreme arrogance that it's almost as difficult to believe as creationism. Having said that, I rather like Dawkins, but like everyone else he can be an arse sometimes. I'd like some evidence that Richard Dawkins tars all Christians with the same brush. I don't like it when people do that, but I'm a big fan of Dawkins' work precisely because he doesn't. His argument is more nuanced -- that either you accept that the Bible is the undiluted word of God, in which case you should follow it to the letter, or you pick and choose bits to follow, in which case you're applying some extra-religious method of arbitration. As for the religion and morality argument, I don't get particularly worked up by people talking about Christian morality, but it's patently false -- precisely because most people don't follow the Bible literally, and because people all around the world have a very similar sense of morality even if they haven't been exposed to Judeo-Christian religion. How do you respond to the fact that Richard Dawkins supports teaching of religious education in the national curriculum? Oh, I think your comments are very apposite, Maria. I often hear fellow Christians deride atheists as being morally defective or not having a moral compass. It is very simplistic to say that atheism in itself causes immorality, not least when we can all think of Christian leaders who have turned out to be seriously 'morally defective'. Secular Scandinavia is a more civilised area of the world than many religious cultures. (I say that because US fundies love to bash poor Sweden, for some reason, as an example of European godlessness. The Swedes might be 'godless' but their infrastructure and the plumbing are marvellous. And they have a low crime rate!) The opposite response, that ALL religion is evil and should be wiped from the face of the earth, is equally ignorant and short-sighted. And just as arrogant. (A secular, post-Christian society has many contradictions: it's OK in popular culture to lampoon the person of Christ but being irreverent about the Prophet Mohammed is off-limits because of potential repercussions. It does strike me as a double standard, and hypocritical too: either all religions are off-limits for humour, or none of them are.) I don't know whether you ever watch 4thoughtTV on Channel 4, but it's a great little 4-minute slot just before 8pm, when anyone -- famous or just an ordinary member of the public -- can share their opinion on ethics and religion. The other night David Baddiel was on. David is Jewish, a comedian and playwright, and he described himself as a 'fundamental atheist' who has no problem with religion. He said he really likes Christmas, often goes to church at Christmas and enjoys hearing a good sermon! He said he recognised the inherent poetry and lyricism in religion and he understood why people needed to have faith, even though he himself was an atheist. I found his comments very honest. No thinking Christian could deny that some truly horrible things have been done in the name of our faith. The fault, however, lies within man. I don't believe that if religion were to disappear from the earth, then humanity's propensity for greed, power and corruption would somehow magically disappear either. The militant atheism of Communism is certainly one of the reasons why I dislike it. But it's not the only reason: I also think that Communism is unworkable as a political and economic system. Yes, the leading Communists deliberately replaced the icons of religion with their own exalted selves, and that kind of hubris will end in disaster one way or another, even if it takes 70 years. Organised atheism in Communist countries also led to the imprisonment, persecution and killing of millions of Christians and other faith-groups. And it still does! -- Amnesty International reckon there are 200,000 thousand political prisoners interned in horrific labour camps in North Korea, and 70,000 of those 'enemies of the state' are Christians. But atheism is not the sole factor at work here: the Church has sometimes perpetrated horrors too, not least against other Christians! What the great Communist failure proves to me that an imperfect humanity is capable of abusing ANY system. In the case of Communism, the 'useful peg' to hang oppression on happened to be officially sanctioned atheism. The one thing that is true of all religions is that they make positive assertions about the universe and a deity without a shred of evidential support. All we have are several times translated fairy-tales from hundreds, sometimes thousands of years ago, used to justify the world as is or should be today. Most atheists I know, and I include Dawkins and Hitchens in that number, do not question the right of others to believe in fairytales. What we object to is the use of institutions like the state to entrench religious norms and the disingenuous appropriation of ""values"" to religions when the good ones are pretty much always secular ones and the bad ones can scarcely be called ""values"" at all. The problem with those who cherry-pick is that we have to ask, as any good empiricist would: ""if you are willing to disregard one bit, why should you not disregard the whole lot?"" This is an argument to consistency in evidence, and not a shrill questioning of your not being pro-genocide. Anything which is not consistent struggles to resemble what one could call rational. You also seem under the misapprehension that atheism is a belief system. This is a common straw man promulgated by religious types with which I am all too familiar. Atheism is not a belief system. It is merely the absence of a belief in a deity. By definition it is NOT a system of beliefs. Unless someone is a strong atheist (which as far as I know, neither Hitchens nor Dawkins are) there is no positive statement or ""article of faith"" being made. People (usually on the theist side of the discussion) fail to distinguish between the statements ""I do not believe in a God"" ""There is probably no God"" and ""I disbelieve in the existence of a God"". Indeed the second of those three statements actually fits more semantically agreeably with the first than the third. Complaining about presentation of arguments is what is commonly known as either concern or tone trolling. The very point the atheist makes is that the way arguments are presented have no bearing on their validity. Further atheists don't ""shove their 'beliefs' down the throats of others"". They don't ask for special privileges. They don't ask for ""atheist"" schools. They don't ask for atheist representatives in the House of Lords. They don't ask for special recognition through the tax system to have charitable status of ""atheist"" bodies fast-tracked. They don't ask for religious symbols to be banned. They don't ask for churches to be banned. They don't ask for the abolition of religion. All they seek is a level playing field for ideas instead of this illogical and institutional special treatment that is given to organisations simply because they *are religious*. They should be treated just like anything else, because regardless of the normative impact of religion on society in instilling particular value-sets, it's not a justification either for their supernatural claims or indeed those values themselves. As for this ""do they try to make themselves feel superior"": this is a load of nonsense as well. Even if this were the case, the mere fact of hubris has no bearing on the validity of the arguments. This isn't about letting the irrational trump the rational. This is a very human reaction which response to ridiculous arguments. Stop tone trolling. As for the ""I'll laugh at anyone who believes in fairies"" it's underpinned by a perfectly valid logical argument: that positive beliefs with no empirical base are as meaningless and infantile as a ""genuinely held belief"" in a flying spaghetti monster. The obnoxiousness of a statement has no bearing on its underlying premise and the validity thereof. Stop tone trolling. And of course religions are a product of human thought (though not, might I add, necessarily human rationality). But that doesn't mean that these religions have any claim over these values. Indeed they could only lay claim to these values if they also lay claim to the aberrations such as anti-homosexuality, anti-contraception and more that they continue to make worse in the world. You cannot name a single moral value that cannot be reached without reference to religion. Just because religion was present and the coercive force used to make a conduct and its associated values normative, does not mean that it is a religious value. What you're saying is tantamount to arguing post hoc ergo propter hoc. Atheists do not ""overlook"" these assertions about ""Christian values""; they challenge your basis for labeling values based on what religion happened to be around at the time. You'd be as well saying that it's a ""Christian value"" to have uncomfortable benches in public because they've had really narrow pews in Churches for a long time! But if we are to go down this consequentialist road, since when was a war waged in the name of atheism? Dawkins and Hitchens have never said that ""all activity of a religious nature tends to negative consequences"" but rather religion has been the basis for some of the most horrible conflicts in recent times. Religion also stops people thinking rationally. Definitionally, articles of faith are irrational. They are not based in evidence/empirical observation. We do make general observations that more rational societies are generally ""less-wrong"" on other issues. We do not impute causation, because there is insufficient proof. But we observe the correlation is strong. I say all of this as a son of the Manse. Both my parents are (extremely liberal) Church of Scotland ministers. I used to describe myself by the same denomination. 12 or so months ago, I concluded that I could no longer honestly hold that pretense. I hold no ill-will against those who want to believe in that which I regard, given the evidence, as ridiculous. But I, like many other atheists, simply ask that this is reciprocated, and that religious bodies receive no preferential treatment. Our argument is a secular one, which even some of the religious should feel comfortable supporting. I'm no friend of religion, but the sneering condescension and monomaniac obsession of some of the militant atheists I have encountered in real life and online (but especially on that Mecca for nutters of every flavour, the Guardian comment boards). My only reservation is that, I guess, I don't share your belief that -- politically or religiously -- moderatism is always the way forward. mpg - I would say that it is perfectly possible to discuss or question the viability of liberal religion. My answer would be that it is perfectly viable, because it's being practiced very widely in the western world (in the US as well, in fact) and as yet doesn't seem to show any signs of disappearing -- although moderate religious views seem to be in decline in some parts of the western world which I, personally, consider a pity. I can see that there might be arguments concerning the internal logic of a liberal religious stance -- but as a self-declared liberal Roman Catholic, I am intensely relaxed about that. I would have thought that in the end, the degree of wishy-washy liberalism anybody is allowing to enter into their religious framework has to be a matter of personal conscience or political taste, just as would be the case with any decision concerning a religious person's exact location in the complex matrix of factors that define one's religious convictions and one's place within a religious community. Outside mathematics (which is an ideal, rather than real part of the world) I have yet to come across a system that can maintain a completely consistent internal logic. I don't think religion fits that picture, either, so everybody has to wrestle with the logical contradictions arising from their particular interpretation. I think that people who assume that one can avoid logical inconsistencies in a religious system, especially a system based on a book as evidently inconsistent as the Bible probably might want to take another look and ask a few more questions... A very cogent, thorough reply indeed. If I may play devil's advocate for a moment (I am a 'liberal' Buddhist myself, which essentially means I'm not a very good Buddhist), I think that when New Atheism (Dawkins, the late, great Hitchens et al), argues against fundamentalism alone, the thinking is that, given the background beliefs, and particularly in the case of the Abrahamic faiths, a fundamentalist interpretation is the one most probable to be true. So when NA focuses on fundamentalism, it is taking on the strongest case for a theistic belief. That seems defensible to me (at least not having thought about it too deeply). And as you acknowledge, I think that there are serious arguments against 'liberal' religion that make it, from an outsiders point of view, improbable. I can think of a modified Pascal's Wager, for example. One's religious liberalism may be false and fundamentalism may be true, the price of being wrong about religious liberalism could be grave, therefore it is more rational to hold to religious fundamentalism (this should really be religious conservatism, but I hope you get my point). Now, having advocated for the Devil long enough, I share your concerns on the state of discourse between the religious and the sceptics. NA tends towards a very narrow stereotyped view of theistic belief, and I don't think one has to lampoon theists in order to be sceptical of theism. Especially when many theists number among the most cutting edge thinkers in science, philosophy, et al. You know i read through this blog, and through comments, but i thought i would enlighten on a few things. For 1. people arent posting stuff to try and make a difference in the world, if you want to make a difference then take away religion in general. Its an out dated notion that should have died out but didn't. All it does is cause conflict between people. So for change to happen then you have to take away the things that people have problems with. Athiest have religious people, and religious people have other religious people that dont believe what they believe. ",5,5

"Leeds pilot evaluation The programme was established with the aim of evaluating the potential benefits of shared road space in a variety of Home Zones across England and Wales . The Methleys Home Zone is to the north of Leeds City Centre and employed such measures as gateway treatments , Home Zone signing , shared road space , traffic calming and hard and soft landscaping . In order to assess the effectiveness of these measures , a programme of ' before ' and ' after ' monitoring was undertaken . This included household interview surveys with adults and children , collection of traffic flow , speed and accident data , video recording to observe residents behaviour in the shared space , air quality and noise monitoring . The interviews revealed that the majority of resident 's supported the Home Zone scheme and felt it had had a positive impact , whilst half of the adults surveyed thought that motorists were now more considerate to children playing in the street . From the children came a list of the most popular outdoor activities including riding bikes , playing football , chatting and ' hanging around ' with friends . Notably , mean traffic speeds were reduced by 6 mph and traffic flows fell by 10 per cent . The question of on-street car parking spaces and the desire to park close to home to reduce the risk of crime was an area of main concern raised by the residents during the consultation process . On-street parking spaces were reduced by 16 % but generally in areas not directly overlooked by houses . The Home Zone measures had little impact on modal shift or how often people walked , cycled or drove . Similarly , they had little impact on noise levels and kerbside concentrations of benzene and nitrogen oxides . This first evaluation report demonstrates the value of robust monitoring both ' before ' and ' after ' the introduction of Home Zone Schemes and provides quality information for town planners to call upon when considering such schemes in the future .

"Roosters break away from Bombers By Greg Best South Warrnambool's Shane O'Leary attempts to send the ball forward, while Cobden's Greg Tongs does his best to hold it up. EVERYONE'S been talking about reigning premier South Warrnambool's long injury list, so much so coach Matthew Peake is sick of hearing his side is ""gone"". He has gone to great lengths to put a positive spin on the predicament facing the Roosters -- which have lost co-captains Jarrod Thompson and Joe Dalton for at least two months, premiership co-captain Danny Finn for an unspecified time and, among others, young gun Jordan Brown for the rest of the season. But on Saturday, against the odds, the weather gods and a brave Cobden line-up, the Roosters did the talking with a 35-point victory, sending a clear message to the rest of the competition -- ""write us off at your own peril."" Peake and his assistant coach Adam Matheson hailed the 11.8 (74) to 5.9 (39) result a victory for positive thinking. Pre-game, they adopted a mantra demanding players have the right attitude, including a belief they could win no matter the circumstances. Trailing by four points at three-quarter-time on a heavy Friendly Societies' Park surface that resembled a cow paddock, the Roosters kicked 6.4 to 0.1 in the final quarter with the aid of a westerly wind. What the tallies from the term didn't say is that Cobden dominated the third term and made all the running in the first eight minutes of the final quarter. The Roosters eked the ball forward and at the nine-minute mark hard nut Shane O'Leary, on something of a kamikaze mission, fearlessly threw himself in the path of approaching Cobden defenders and won a free kick 35 metres out from the goal. His attack on the ball saw it spill free and with the advantage paid by the umpires, forward Sam Kelly soccered a goal to put the Roosters in front. Eighty seconds later, Kelly marked on the Koroit Street half-forward flank, wheeled on to his left-foot from the boundary line and from outside 50 metres kicked another goal to extend the margin to seven points. Kelly's fourth goal took the game away from Cobden but when Adam Wolfe marked and converted from a set shot after a battle between defences at the 21-minute mark, the result wasn't in doubt. Three minutes later Peake kicked the ball out of mid-air from near the boundary line to the top of the goal square where Wolfe marked and kicked another goal. Wolfe then kicked another at the 26-minute mark before Peake celebrated with a goal on the run at the 29-minute mark. The 35-point margin didn't reflect the evenness of the contest. Kelly's two goals to start the final term were the first time either side had managed to kick consecutive majors. South Warrnambool, which lost key forward Kym Eagleson in the second term to a shin injury, made a number of successful moves. Peake started in the centre for the first time this season with star James Hussey taking his place at half-back. Dylan Cahill was given a licence to run on the wing instead of being at half-back and veteran Jacob Rhodes, in his comeback to senior footy with the Roosters after three years was used in the middle and across half-back to good effect. ""I reckon we've been lacking that outside run,"" Peake said. ""We are probably not playing to our strength of running, we have a lot of in and under players. Our guys were a lot smarter in assessing when to go into the contest or when to stay out."" It was noticeable in the first term and again in the last. Bombers ruckman Levi Dare dominated the match and threatened to take it away from the Roosters in the second and third terms. His precision ruck work in the conditions, pack marking and ability to win the ball at ground level made him the most decisive figure on the ground. In the third term he plucked seven contested marks and booted a team-lifting goal from outside the 50-metre arc. On Saturday's performance, he could be heading towards his second Maskell Medal in three seasons. Dare's brother Joe, who was good at half-back and in the middle, suffered what coach Wayne Robertson believed was a dislocated elbow in the last quarter. Despite returning to the field briefly after having it strapped up, he went to hospital and is expected to be sidelined for Saturday's showdown with North Warrnambool Eagles. Another Bomber to miss that match will be defender Greg Tongs, who was instrumental early, but suffered a hamstring injury in the third term. The Roosters were relieved that Eagleson, who went to hospital for precautionary xrays, had suffered no serious damage and while sore, could yet play against ladder-leader Camperdown on Saturday.

"The little mermaid Far out in the ocean , where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower , and as clear as crystal , it is very , very deep ; so deep , indeed , that no cable could fathom it : many church steeples , piled one upon another , would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above . There dwell the Sea King and his subjects . We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand . No , indeed ; the most singular flowers and plants grow there ; the leaves and stems of which are so pliant , that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life . Fishes , both large and small , glide between the branches , as birds fly among the trees here upon land . In the deepest spot of all , stands the castle of the Sea King . Its walls are built of coral , and the long , gothic windows are of the clearest amber . The roof is formed of shells , that open and close as the water flows over them . Their appearance is very beautiful , for in each lies a glittering pearl , which would be fit for the diadem of a queen . The Sea King had been a widower for many years , and his aged mother kept house for him . She was a very wise woman , and exceedingly proud of her high birth ; on that account she wore twelve oysters on her tail ; while others , also of high rank , were only allowed to wear six . She was , however , deserving of very great praise , especially for her care of the little sea-princesses , her grand-daughters . They were six beautiful children ; but the youngest was the prettiest of them all ; her skin was as clear and delicate as a rose-leaf , and her eyes as blue as the deepest sea ; but , like all the others , she had no feet , and her body ended in a fish's tail . All day long they played in the great halls of the castle , or among the living flowers that grew out of the walls . The large amber windows were open , and the fish swam in , just as the swallows fly into our houses when we open the windows , excepting that the fishes swam up to the princesses , ate out of their hands , and allowed themselves to be stroked . Outside the castle there was a beautiful garden , in which grew bright red and dark blue flowers , and blossoms like flames of fire ; the fruit glittered like gold , and the leaves and stems waved to and fro continually . The earth itself was the finest sand , but blue as the flame of burning sulphur . Over everything lay a peculiar blue radiance , as if it were surrounded by the air from above , through which the blue sky shone , instead of the dark depths of the sea . In calm weather the sun could be seen , looking like a purple flower , with the light streaming from the calyx . Each of the young princesses had a little plot of ground in the garden , where she might dig and plant as she pleased . One arranged her flower-bed into the form of a whale ; another thought it better to make hers like the figure of a little mermaid ; but that of the youngest was round like the sun , and contained flowers as red as his rays at sunset . She was a strange child , quiet and thoughtful ; and while her sisters would be delighted with the wonderful things which they obtained from the wrecks of vessels , she cared for nothing but her pretty red flowers , like the sun , excepting a beautiful marble statue . It was the representation of a handsome boy , carved out of pure white stone , which had fallen to the bottom of the sea from a wreck . She planted by the statue a rose-colored weeping willow . It grew splendidly , and very soon hung its fresh branches over the statue , almost down to the blue sands . The shadow had a violet tint , and waved to and fro like the branches ; it seemed as if the crown of the tree and the root were at play , and trying to kiss each other . Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea . She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns , the people and the animals . To her it seemed most wonderful and beautiful to hear that the flowers of the land should have fragrance , and not those below the sea ; that the trees of the forest should be green ; and that the fishes among the trees could sing so sweetly , that it was quite a pleasure to hear them . Her grandmother called the little birds fishes , or she would not have understood her ; for she had never seen birds . "" When you have reached your fifteenth year , "" said the grand-mother , "" you will have permission to rise up out of the sea , to sit on the rocks in the moonlight , while the great ships are sailing by ; and then you will see both forests and towns . "" In the following year , one of the sisters would be fifteen : but as each was a year younger than the other , the youngest would have to wait five years before her turn came to rise up from the bottom of the ocean , and see the earth as we do . However , each promised to tell the others what she saw on her first visit , and what she thought the most beautiful ; for their grandmother could not tell them enough ; there were so many things on which they wanted information . None of them longed so much for her turn to come as the youngest , she who had the longest time to wait , and who was so quiet and thoughtful . Many nights she stood by the open window , looking up through the dark blue water , and watching the fish as they splashed about with their fins and tails . She could see the moon and stars shining faintly ; but through the water they looked larger than they do to our eyes . When something like a black cloud passed between her and them , she knew that it was either a whale swimming over her head , or a ship full of human beings , who never imagined that a pretty little mermaid was standing beneath them , holding out her white hands towards the keel of their ship . As soon as the eldest was fifteen , she was allowed to rise to the surface of the ocean . When she came back , she had hundreds of things to talk about ; but the most beautiful , she said , was to lie in the moonlight , on a sandbank , in the quiet sea , near the coast , and to gaze on a large town nearby , where the lights were twinkling like hundreds of stars ; to listen to the sounds of the music , the noise of carriages , and the voices of human beings , and then to hear the merry bells peal out from the church steeples ; and because she could not go near to all those wonderful things , she longed for them more than ever . Oh , did not the youngest sister listen eagerly to all these descriptions ? and afterwards , when she stood at the open window looking up through the dark blue water , she thought of the great city , with all its bustle and noise , and even fancied she could hear the sound of the church bells , down in the depths of the sea . In another year the second sister received permission to rise to the surface of the water , and to swim about where she pleased . She rose just as the sun was setting , and this , she said , was the most beautiful sight of all . The whole sky looked like gold , while violet and rose-colored clouds , which she could not describe , floated over her ; and , still more rapidly than the clouds , flew a large flock of wild swans towards the setting sun , looking like a long white veil across the sea . She also swam towards the sun ; but it sunk into the waves , and the rosy tints faded from the clouds and from the sea . The third sister's turn followed ; she was the boldest of them all , and she swam up a broad river that emptied itself into the sea . On the banks she saw green hills covered with beautiful vines ; palaces and castles peeped out from amid the proud trees of the forest ; she heard the birds singing , and the rays of the sun were so powerful that she was obliged often to dive down under the water to cool her burning face . In a narrow creek she found a whole troop of little human children , quite naked , and sporting about in the water ; she wanted to play with them , but they fled in a great fright ; and then a little black animal came to the water ; it was a dog , but she did not know that , for she had never before seen one . This animal barked at her so terribly that she became frightened , and rushed back to the open sea . But she said she should never forget the beautiful forest , the green hills , and the pretty little children who could swim in the water , although they had not fish's tails . The fourth sister was more timid ; she remained in the midst of the sea , but she said it was quite as beautiful there as nearer the land . She could see for so many miles around her , and the sky above looked like a bell of glass . She had seen the ships , but at such a great distance that they looked like sea-gulls . The dolphins sported in the waves , and the great whales spouted water from their nostrils till it seemed as if a hundred fountains were playing in every direction . The fifth sister's birthday occurred in the winter ; so when her turn came , she saw what the others had not seen the first time they went up . The sea looked quite green , and large icebergs were floating about , each like a pearl , she said , but larger and loftier than the churches built by men . They were of the most singular shapes , and glittered like diamonds . She had seated herself upon one of the largest , and let the wind play with her long hair , and she remarked that all the ships sailed by rapidly , and steered as far away as they could from the iceberg , as if they were afraid of it . Towards evening , as the sun went down , dark clouds covered the sky , the thunder rolled and the lightning flashed , and the red light glowed on the icebergs as they rocked and tossed on the heaving sea . On all the ships the sails were reefed with fear and trembling , while she sat calmly on the floating iceberg , watching the blue lightning , as it darted its forked flashes into the sea . When first the sisters had permission to rise to the surface , they were each delighted with the new and beautiful sights they saw ; but now , as grown-up girls , they could go when they pleased , and they had become indifferent about it . They wished themselves back again in the water , and after a month had passed they said it was much more beautiful down below , and pleasanter to be at home . Yet often , in the evening hours , the five sisters would twine their arms round each other , and rise to the surface , in a row . They had more beautiful voices than any human being could have ; and before the approach of a storm , and when they expected a ship would be lost , they swam before the vessel , and sang sweetly of the delights to be found in the depths of the sea , and begging the sailors not to fear if they sank to the bottom . But the sailors could not understand the song , they took it for the howling of the storm . And these things were never to be beautiful for them ; for if the ship sank , the men were drowned , and their dead bodies alone reached the palace of the Sea King . When the sisters rose , arm-in-arm , through the water in this way , their youngest sister would stand quite alone , looking after them , ready to cry , only that the mermaids have no tears , and therefore they suffer more . "" Oh , were I but fifteen years old , "" said she : "" I know that I shall love the world up there , and all the people who live in it . "" At last she reached her fifteenth year . "" Well , now , you are grown up , "" said the old dowager , her grandmother ; "" so you must let me adorn you like your other sisters ; "" and she placed a wreath of white lilies in her hair , and every flower leaf was half a pearl . Then the old lady ordered eight great oysters to attach themselves to the tail of the princess to show her high rank . "" But they hurt me so , "" said the little mermaid . "" Pride must suffer pain , "" replied the old lady . Oh , how gladly she would have shaken off all this grandeur , and laid aside the heavy wreath ! The red flowers in her own garden would have suited her much better , but she could not help herself : so she said , "" Farewell , "" and rose as lightly as a bubble to the surface of the water . The sun had just set as she raised her head above the waves ; but the clouds were tinted with crimson and gold , and through the glimmering twilight beamed the evening star in all its beauty . The sea was calm , and the air mild and fresh . A large ship , with three masts , lay becalmed on the water , with only one sail set ; for not a breeze stiffed , and the sailors sat idle on deck or amongst the rigging . There was music and song on board ; and , as darkness came on , a hundred colored lanterns were lighted , as if the flags of all nations waved in the air . The little mermaid swam close to the cabin windows ; and now and then , as the waves lifted her up , she could look in through clear glass window-panes , and see a number of well-dressed people within . Among them was a young prince , the most beautiful of all , with large black eyes ; he was sixteen years of age , and his birthday was being kept with much rejoicing . The sailors were dancing on deck , but when the prince came out of the cabin , more than a hundred rockets rose in the air , making it as bright as day . The little mermaid was so startled that she dived under water ; and when she again stretched out her head , it appeared as if all the stars of heaven were falling around her , she had never seen such fireworks before . Great suns spurted fire about , splendid fireflies flew into the blue air , and everything was reflected in the clear , calm sea beneath . The ship itself was so brightly illuminated that all the people , and even the smallest rope , could be distinctly and plainly seen . And how handsome the young prince looked , as he pressed the hands of all present and smiled at them , while the music resounded through the clear night air . It was very late ; yet the little mermaid could not take her eyes from the ship , or from the beautiful prince . The colored lanterns had been extinguished , no more rockets rose in the air , and the cannon had ceased firing ; but the sea became restless , and a moaning , grumbling sound could be heard beneath the waves : still the little mermaid remained by the cabin window , rocking up and down on the water , which enabled her to look in . After a while , the sails were quickly unfurled , and the noble ship continued her passage ; but soon the waves rose higher , heavy clouds darkened the sky , and lightning appeared in the distance . A dreadful storm was approaching ; once more the sails were reefed , and the great ship pursued her flying course over the raging sea . The waves rose mountains high , as if they would have overtopped the mast ; but the ship dived like a swan between them , and then rose again on their lofty , foaming crests . To the little mermaid this appeared pleasant sport ; not so to the sailors . At length the ship groaned and creaked ; the thick planks gave way under the lashing of the sea as it broke over the deck ; the mainmast snapped asunder like a reed ; the ship lay over on her side ; and the water rushed in . The little mermaid now perceived that the crew were in danger ; even she herself was obliged to be careful to avoid the beams and planks of the wreck which lay scattered on the water . At one moment it was so pitch dark that she could not see a single object , but a flash of lightning revealed the whole scene ; she could see every one who had been on board excepting the prince ; when the ship parted , she had seen him sink into the deep waves , and she was glad , for she thought he would now be with her ; and then she remembered that human beings could not live in the water , so that when he got down to her father's palace he would be quite dead . But he must not die . So she swam about among the beams and planks which strewed the surface of the sea , forgetting that they could crush her to pieces . Then she dived deeply under the dark waters , rising and falling with the waves , till at length she managed to reach the young prince , who was fast losing the power of swimming in that stormy sea . His limbs were failing him , his beautiful eyes were closed , and he would have died had not the little mermaid come to his assistance . She held his head above the water , and let the waves drift them where they would . In the morning the storm had ceased ; but of the ship not a single fragment could be seen . The sun rose up red and glowing from the water , and its beams brought back the hue of health to the prince's cheeks ; but his eyes remained closed . The mermaid kissed his high , smooth forehead , and stroked back his wet hair ; he seemed to her like the marble statue in her little garden , and she kissed him again , and wished that he might live . Presently they came in sight of land ; she saw lofty blue mountains , on which the white snow rested as if a flock of swans were lying upon them . Near the coast were beautiful green forests , and close by stood a large building , whether a church or a convent she could not tell . Orange and citron trees grew in the garden , and before the door stood lofty palms . The sea here formed a little bay , in which the water was quite still , but very deep ; so she swam with the handsome prince to the beach , which was covered with fine , white sand , and there she laid him in the warm sunshine , taking care to raise his head higher than his body . Then bells sounded in the large white building , and a number of young girls came into the garden . The little mermaid swam out farther from the shore and placed herself between some high rocks that rose out of the water ; then she covered her head and neck with the foam of the sea so that her little face might not be seen , and watched to see what would become of the poor prince . She did not wait long before she saw a young girl approach the spot where he lay . She seemed frightened at first , but only for a moment ; then she fetched a number of people , and the mermaid saw that the prince came to life again , and smiled upon those who stood round him . But to her he sent no smile ; he knew not that she had saved him . This made her very unhappy , and when he was led away into the great building , she dived down sorrowfully into the water , and returned to her father's castle . She had always been silent and thoughtful , and now she was more so than ever . Her sisters asked her what she had seen during her first visit to the surface of the water ; but she would tell them nothing . Many an evening and morning did she rise to the place where she had left the prince . She saw the fruits in the garden ripen till they were gathered , the snow on the tops of the mountains melt away ; but she never saw the prince , and therefore she returned home , always more sorrowful than before . It was her only comfort to sit in her own little garden , and fling her arm round the beautiful marble statue which was like the prince ; but she gave up tending her flowers , and they grew in wild confusion over the paths , twining their long leaves and stems round the branches of the trees , so that the whole place became dark and gloomy . At length she could bear it no longer , and told one of her sisters all about it . Then the others heard the secret , and very soon it became known to two mermaids whose intimate friend happened to know who the prince was . She had also seen the festival on board ship , and she told them where the prince came from , and where his palace stood . "" Come , little sister , "" said the other princesses ; then they entwined their arms and rose up in a long row to the surface of the water , close by the spot where they knew the prince's palace stood . It was built of bright yellow shining stone , with long flights of marble steps , one of which reached quite down to the sea . Splendid gilded cupolas rose over the roof , and between the pillars that surrounded the whole building stood life-like statues of marble . Through the clear crystal of the lofty windows could be seen noble rooms , with costly silk curtains and hangings of tapestry ; while the walls were covered with beautiful paintings which were a pleasure to look at . In the centre of the largest saloon a fountain threw its sparkling jets high up into the glass cupola of the ceiling , through which the sun shone down upon the water and upon the beautiful plants growing round the basin of the fountain . Now that she knew where he lived , she spent many an evening and many a night on the water near the palace . She would swim much nearer the shore than any of the others ventured to do ; indeed once she went quite up the narrow channel under the marble balcony , which threw a broad shadow on the water . Here she would sit and watch the young prince , who thought himself quite alone in the bright moonlight . She saw him many times of an evening sailing in a pleasant boat , with music playing and flags waving . She peeped out from among the green rushes , and if the wind caught her long silvery-white veil , those who saw it believed it to be a swan , spreading out its wings . On many a night , too , when the fishermen , with their torches , were out at sea , she heard them relate so many good things about the doings of the young prince , that she was glad she had saved his life when he had been tossed about half-dead on the waves . And she remembered that his head had rested on her bosom , and how heartily she had kissed him ; but he knew nothing of all this , and could not even dream of her . She grew more and more fond of human beings , and wished more and more to be able to wander about with those whose world seemed to be so much larger than her own . They could fly over the sea in ships , and mount the high hills which were far above the clouds ; and the lands they possessed , their woods and their fields , stretched far away beyond the reach of her sight . There was so much that she wished to know , and her sisters were unable to answer all her questions . Then she applied to her old grandmother , who knew all about the upper world , which she very rightly called the lands above the sea . "" If human beings are not drowned , "" asked the little mermaid , "" can they live forever ? do they never die as we do here in the sea ? "" "" Yes , "" replied the old lady , "" they must also die , and their term of life is even shorter than ours . We sometimes live to three hundred years , but when we cease to exist here we only become the foam on the surface of the water , and we have not even a grave down here of those we love . We have not immortal souls , we shall never live again ; but , like the green sea-weed , when once it has been cut off , we can never flourish more . Human beings , on the contrary , have a soul which lives forever , lives after the body has been turned to dust . It rises up through the clear , pure air beyond the glittering stars . As we rise out of the water , and behold all the land of the earth , so do they rise to unknown and glorious regions which we shall never see . "" "" Why have not we an immortal soul ? "" asked the little mermaid mournfully ; "" I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live , to be a human being only for one day , and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars . "" "" You must not think of that , "" said the old woman ; "" we feel ourselves to be much happier and much better off than human beings . "" "" So I shall die , "" said the little mermaid , "" and as the foam of the sea I shall be driven about never again to hear the music of the waves , or to see the pretty flowers nor the red sun . Is there anything I can do to win an immortal soul ? "" "" No , "" said the old woman , "" unless a man were to love you so much that you were more to him than his father or mother ; and if all his thoughts and all his love were fixed upon you , and the priest placed his right hand in yours , and he promised to be true to you here and hereafter , then his soul would glide into your body and you would obtain a share in the future happiness of mankind . He would give a soul to you and retain his own as well ; but this can never happen . Your fish's tail , which amongst us is considered so beautiful , is thought on earth to be quite ugly ; they do not know any better , and they think it necessary to have two stout props , which they call legs , in order to be handsome . "" Then the little mermaid sighed , and looked sorrowfully at her fish's tail . "" Let us be happy , "" said the old lady , "" and dart and spring about during the three hundred years that we have to live , which is really quite long enough ; after that we can rest ourselves all the better . This evening we are going to have a court ball . "" It is one of those splendid sights which we can never see on earth . The walls and the ceiling of the large ball-room were of thick , but transparent crystal . May hundreds of colossal shells , some of a deep red , others of a grass green , stood on each side in rows , with blue fire in them , which lighted up the whole saloon , and shone through the walls , so that the sea was also illuminated . Innumerable fishes , great and small , swam past the crystal walls ; on some of them the scales glowed with a purple brilliancy , and on others they shone like silver and gold . Through the halls flowed a broad stream , and in it danced the mermen and the mermaids to the music of their own sweet singing . No one on earth has such a lovely voice as theirs . The little mermaid sang more sweetly than them all . The whole court applauded her with hands and tails ; and for a moment her heart felt quite gay , for she knew she had the loveliest voice of any on earth or in the sea . But she soon thought again of the world above her , for she could not forget the charming prince , nor her sorrow that she had not an immortal soul like his ; therefore she crept away silently out of her father's palace , and while everything within was gladness and song , she sat in her own little garden sorrowful and alone . Then she heard the bugle sounding through the water , and thought – "" He is certainly sailing above , he on whom my wishes depend , and in whose hands I should like to place the happiness of my life . I will venture all for him , and to win an immortal soul , while my sisters are dancing in my father's palace , I will go to the sea witch , of whom I have always been so much afraid , but she can give me counsel and help . "" And then the little mermaid went out from her garden , and took the road to the foaming whirlpools , behind which the sorceress lived . She had never been that way before : neither flowers nor grass grew there ; nothing but bare , gray , sandy ground stretched out to the whirlpool , where the water , like foaming mill-wheels , whirled round everything that it seized , and cast it into the fathomless deep . Through the midst of these crushing whirlpools the little mermaid was obliged to pass , to reach the dominions of the sea witch ; and also for a long distance the only road lay right across a quantity of warm , bubbling mire , called by the witch her turfmoor . Beyond this stood her house , in the centre of a strange forest , in which all the trees and flowers were polypi , half animals and half plants ; they looked like serpents with a hundred heads growing out of the ground . The branches were long slimy arms , with fingers like flexible worms , moving limb after limb from the root to the top . All that could be reached in the sea they seized upon , and held fast , so that it never escaped from their clutches . The little mermaid was so alarmed at what she saw , that she stood still , and her heart beat with fear , and she was very nearly turning back ; but she thought of the prince , and of the human soul for which she longed , and her courage returned . She fastened her long flowing hair round her head , so that the polypi might not seize hold of it . She laid her hands together across her bosom , and then she darted forward as a fish shoots through the water , between the supple arms and fingers of the ugly polypi , which were stretched out on each side of her . She saw that each held in its grasp something it had seized with its numerous little arms , as if they were iron bands . The white skeletons of human beings who had perished at sea , and had sunk down into the deep waters , skeletons of land animals , oars , rudders , and chests of ships were lying tightly grasped by their clinging arms ; even a little mermaid , whom they had caught and strangled ; and this seemed the most shocking of all to the little princess . She now came to a space of marshy ground in the wood , where large , fat water-snakes were rolling in the mire , and showing their ugly , drab-colored bodies . In the midst of this spot stood a house , built with the bones of shipwrecked human beings . There sat the sea witch , allowing a toad to eat from her mouth , just as people sometimes feed a canary with a piece of sugar . She called the ugly water-snakes her little chickens , and allowed them to crawl all over her bosom . "" I know what you want , "" said the sea witch ; "" it is very stupid of you , but you shall have your way , and it will bring you to sorrow , my pretty princess . You want to get rid of your fish's tail , and to have two supports instead of it , like human beings on earth , so that the young prince may fall in love with you , and that you may have an immortal soul . "" And then the witch laughed so loud and disgustingly , that the toad and the snakes fell to the ground , and lay there wriggling about . "" You are but just in time , "" said the witch ; "" for after sunrise to-morrow I should not be able to help you till the end of another year . I will prepare a draught for you , with which you must swim to land tomorrow before sunrise , and sit down on the shore and drink it . Your tail will then disappear , and shrink up into what mankind calls legs , and you will feel great pain , as if a sword were passing through you . But all who see you will say that you are the prettiest little human being they ever saw . You will still have the same floating gracefulness of movement , and no dancer will ever tread so lightly ; but at every step you take it will feel as if you were treading upon sharp knives , and that the blood must flow . If you will bear all this , I will help you . "" "" Yes , I will , "" said the little princess in a trembling voice , as she thought of the prince and the immortal soul . "" But think again , "" said the witch ; "" for when once your shape has become like a human being , you can no more be a mermaid . You will never return through the water to your sisters , or to your father's palace again ; and if you do not win the love of the prince , so that he is willing to forget his father and mother for your sake , and to love you with his whole soul , and allow the priest to join your hands that you may be man and wife , then you will never have an immortal soul . The first morning after he marries another your heart will break , and you will become foam on the crest of the waves . "" "" I will do it , "" said the little mermaid , and she became pale as death . "" But I must be paid also , "" said the witch , "" and it is not a trifle that I ask . You have the sweetest voice of any who dwell here in the depths of the sea , and you believe that you will be able to charm the prince with it also , but this voice you must give to me ; the best thing you possess will I have for the price of my draught . My own blood must be mixed with it , that it may be as sharp as a two-edged sword . "" "" But if you take away my voice , "" said the little mermaid , "" what is left for me ? "" "" Your beautiful form , your graceful walk , and your expressive eyes ; surely with these you can enchain a man's heart . Well , have you lost your courage ? Put out your little tongue that I may cut it off as my payment ; then you shall have the powerful draught . "" "" It shall be , "" said the little mermaid . Then the witch placed her cauldron on the fire , to prepare the magic draught . "" Cleanliness is a good thing , "" said she , scouring the vessel with snakes , which she had tied together in a large knot ; then she pricked herself in the breast , and let the black blood drop into it . The steam that rose formed itself into such horrible shapes that no one could look at them without fear . Every moment the witch threw something else into the vessel , and when it began to boil , the sound was like the weeping of a crocodile . When at last the magic draught was ready , it looked like the clearest water . "" There it is for you , "" said the witch . Then she cut off the mermaid's tongue , so that she became dumb , and would never again speak or sing . "" If the polypi should seize hold of you as you return through the wood , "" said the witch , "" throw over them a few drops of the potion , and their fingers will be torn into a thousand pieces . "" But the little mermaid had no occasion to do this , for the polypi sprang back in terror when they caught sight of the glittering draught , which shone in her hand like a twinkling star . So she passed quickly through the wood and the marsh , and between the rushing whirlpools . She saw that in her father's palace the torches in the ballroom were extinguished , and all within asleep ; but she did not venture to go in to them , for now she was dumb and going to leave them forever , she felt as if her heart would break . She stole into the garden , took a flower from the flower-beds of each of her sisters , kissed her hand a thousand times towards the palace , and then rose up through the dark blue waters . The sun had not risen when she came in sight of the prince's palace , and approached the beautiful marble steps , but the moon shone clear and bright . Then the little mermaid drank the magic draught , and it seemed as if a two-edged sword went through her delicate body : she fell into a swoon , and lay like one dead . When the sun arose and shone over the sea , she recovered , and felt a sharp pain ; but just before her stood the handsome young prince . He fixed his coal-black eyes upon her so earnestly that she cast down her own , and then became aware that her fish's tail was gone , and that she had as pretty a pair of white legs and tiny feet as any little maiden could have ; but she had no clothes , so she wrapped herself in her long , thick hair . The prince asked her who she was , and where she came from , and she looked at him mildly and sorrowfully with her deep blue eyes ; but she could not speak . Every step she took was as the witch had said it would be , she felt as if treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives ; but she bore it willingly , and stepped as lightly by the prince's side as a soap-bubble , so that he and all who saw her wondered at her graceful-swaying movements . She was very soon arrayed in costly robes of silk and muslin , and was the most beautiful creature in the palace ; but she was dumb , and could neither speak nor sing . Beautiful female slaves , dressed in silk and gold , stepped forward and sang before the prince and his royal parents : one sang better than all the others , and the prince clapped his hands and smiled at her . This was great sorrow to the little mermaid ; she knew how much more sweetly she herself could sing once , and she thought , "" Oh if he could only know that ! I have given away my voice forever , to be with him . "" The slaves next performed some pretty fairy-like dances , to the sound of beautiful music . Then the little mermaid raised her lovely white arms , stood on the tips of her toes , and glided over the floor , and danced as no one yet had been able to dance . At each moment her beauty became more revealed , and her expressive eyes appealed more directly to the heart than the songs of the slaves . Every one was enchanted , especially the prince , who called her his little foundling ; and she danced again quite readily , to please him , though each time her foot touched the floor it seemed as if she trod on sharp knives . The prince said she should remain with him always , and she received permission to sleep at his door , on a velvet cushion . He had a page's dress made for her , that she might accompany him on horseback . They rode together through the sweet-scented woods , where the green boughs touched their shoulders , and the little birds sang among the fresh leaves . She climbed with the prince to the tops of high mountains ; and although her tender feet bled so that even her steps were marked , she only laughed , and followed him till they could see the clouds beneath them looking like a flock of birds travelling to distant lands . While at the prince's palace , and when all the household were asleep , she would go and sit on the broad marble steps ; for it eased her burning feet to bathe them in the cold sea-water ; and then she thought of all those below in the deep . Once during the night her sisters came up arm-in-arm , singing sorrowfully , as they floated on the water . She beckoned to them , and then they recognized her , and told her how she had grieved them . After that , they came to the same place every night ; and once she saw in the distance her old grandmother , who had not been to the surface of the sea for many years , and the old Sea King , her father , with his crown on his head . They stretched out their hands towards her , but they did not venture so near the land as her sisters did . As the days passed , she loved the prince more fondly , and he loved her as he would love a little child , but it never came into his head to make her his wife ; yet , unless he married her , she could not receive an immortal soul ; and , on the morning after his marriage with another , she would dissolve into the foam of the sea . "" Do you not love me the best of them all ? "" the eyes of the little mermaid seemed to say , when he took her in his arms , and kissed her fair forehead . "" Yes , you are dear to me , "" said the prince ; "" for you have the best heart , and you are the most devoted to me ; you are like a young maiden whom I once saw , but whom I shall never meet again . I was in a ship that was wrecked , and the waves cast me ashore near a holy temple , where several young maidens performed the service . The youngest of them found me on the shore , and saved my life . I saw her but twice , and she is the only one in the world whom I could love ; but you are like her , and you have almost driven her image out of my mind . She belongs to the holy temple , and my good fortune has sent you to me instead of her ; and we will never part . "" "" Ah , he knows not that it was I who saved his life , "" thought the little mermaid . "" I carried him over the sea to the wood where the temple stands : I sat beneath the foam , and watched till the human beings came to help him . I saw the pretty maiden that he loves better than he loves me ; "" and the mermaid sighed deeply , but she could not shed tears . "" He says the maiden belongs to the holy temple , therefore she will never return to the world . They will meet no more : while I am by his side , and see him every day . I will take care of him , and love him , and give up my life for his sake . "" Very soon it was said that the prince must marry , and that the beautiful daughter of a neighboring king would be his wife , for a fine ship was being fitted out . Although the prince gave out that he merely intended to pay a visit to the king , it was generally supposed that he really went to see his daughter . A great company were to go with him . The little mermaid smiled , and shook her head . She knew the prince's thoughts better than any of the others . "" I must travel , "" he had said to her ; "" I must see this beautiful princess ; my parents desire it ; but they will not oblige me to bring her home as my bride . I can not love her ; she is not like the beautiful maiden in the temple , whom you resemble . If I were forced to choose a bride , I would rather choose you , my dumb foundling , with those expressive eyes . "" And then he kissed her rosy mouth , played with her long waving hair , and laid his head on her heart , while she dreamed of human happiness and an immortal soul . "" You are not afraid of the sea , my dumb child , "" said he , as they stood on the deck of the noble ship which was to carry them to the country of the neighboring king . And then he told her of storm and of calm , of strange fishes in the deep beneath them , and of what the divers had seen there ; and she smiled at his descriptions , for she knew better than any one what wonders were at the bottom of the sea . In the moonlight , when all on board were asleep , excepting the man at the helm , who was steering , she sat on the deck , gazing down through the clear water . She thought she could distinguish her father's castle , and upon it her aged grandmother , with the silver crown on her head , looking through the rushing tide at the keel of the vessel . Then her sisters came up on the waves , and gazed at her mournfully , wringing their white hands . She beckoned to them , and smiled , and wanted to tell them how happy and well off she was ; but the cabin-boy approached , and when her sisters dived down he thought it was only the foam of the sea which he saw . The next morning the ship sailed into the harbor of a beautiful town belonging to the king whom the prince was going to visit . The church bells were ringing , and from the high towers sounded a flourish of trumpets ; and soldiers , with flying colors and glittering bayonets , lined the rocks through which they passed . Every day was a festival ; balls and entertainments followed one another . But the princess had not yet appeared . People said that she was being brought up and educated in a religious house , where she was learning every royal virtue . At last she came . Then the little mermaid , who was very anxious to see whether she was really beautiful , was obliged to acknowledge that she had never seen a more perfect vision of beauty . Her skin was delicately fair , and beneath her long dark eye-lashes her laughing blue eyes shone with truth and purity . "" It was you , "" said the prince , "" who saved my life when I lay dead on the beach , "" and he folded his blushing bride in his arms . "" Oh , I am too happy , "" said he to the little mermaid ; "" my fondest hopes are all fulfilled . You will rejoice at my happiness ; for your devotion to me is great and sincere . "" The little mermaid kissed his hand , and felt as if her heart were already broken . His wedding morning would bring death to her , and she would change into the foam of the sea . All the church bells rung , and the heralds rode about the town proclaiming the betrothal . Perfumed oil was burning in costly silver lamps on every altar . The priests waved the censers , while the bride and bridegroom joined their hands and received the blessing of the bishop . The little mermaid , dressed in silk and gold , held up the bride's train ; but her ears heard nothing of the festive music , and her eyes saw not the holy ceremony ; she thought of the night of death which was coming to her , and of all she had lost in the world . On the same evening the bride and bridegroom went on board ship ; cannons were roaring , flags waving , and in the centre of the ship a costly tent of purple and gold had been erected . It contained elegant couches , for the reception of the bridal pair during the night . The ship , with swelling sails and a favorable wind , glided away smoothly and lightly over the calm sea . When it grew dark a number of colored lamps were lit , and the sailors danced merrily on the deck . The little mermaid could not help thinking of her first rising out of the sea , when she had seen similar festivities and joys ; and she joined in the dance , poised herself in the air as a swallow when he pursues his prey , and all present cheered her with wonder . She had never danced so elegantly before . Her tender feet felt as if cut with sharp knives , but she cared not for it ; a sharper pang had pierced through her heart . She knew this was the last evening she should ever see the prince , for whom she had forsaken her kindred and her home ; she had given up her beautiful voice , and suffered unheard-of pain daily for him , while he knew nothing of it . This was the last evening that she would breathe the same air with him , or gaze on the starry sky and the deep sea ; an eternal night , without a thought or a dream , awaited her : she had no soul and now she could never win one . All was joy and gayety on board ship till long after midnight ; she laughed and danced with the rest , while the thoughts of death were in her heart . The prince kissed his beautiful bride , while she played with his raven hair , till they went arm-in-arm to rest in the splendid tent . Then all became still on board the ship ; the helmsman , alone awake , stood at the helm . The little mermaid leaned her white arms on the edge of the vessel , and looked towards the east for the first blush of morning , for that first ray of dawn that would bring her death . She saw her sisters rising out of the flood : they were as pale as herself ; but their long beautiful hair waved no more in the wind , and had been cut off . "" We have given our hair to the witch , "" said they , "" to obtain help for you , that you may not die to-night . She has given us a knife : here it is , see it is very sharp . Before the sun rises you must plunge it into the heart of the prince ; when the warm blood falls upon your feet they will grow together again , and form into a fish's tail , and you will be once more a mermaid , and return to us to live out your three hundred years before you die and change into the salt sea foam . Haste , then ; he or you must die before sunrise . Our old grandmother moans so for you , that her white hair is falling off from sorrow , as ours fell under the witch's scissors . Kill the prince and come back ; hasten : do you not see the first red streaks in the sky ? In a few minutes the sun will rise , and you must die . "" And then they sighed deeply and mournfully , and sank down beneath the waves . The little mermaid drew back the crimson curtain of the tent , and beheld the fair bride with her head resting on the prince's breast . She bent down and kissed his fair brow , then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter ; then she glanced at the sharp knife , and again fixed her eyes on the prince , who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams . She was in his thoughts , and the knife trembled in the hand of the little mermaid : then she flung it far away from her into the waves ; the water turned red where it fell , and the drops that spurted up looked like blood . She cast one more lingering , half-fainting glance at the prince , and then threw herself from the ship into the sea , and thought her body was dissolving into foam . The sun rose above the waves , and his warm rays fell on the cold foam of the little mermaid , who did not feel as if she were dying . She saw the bright sun , and all around her floated hundreds of transparent beautiful beings ; she could see through them the white sails of the ship , and the red clouds in the sky ; their speech was melodious , but too ethereal to be heard by mortal ears , as they were also unseen by mortal eyes . The little mermaid perceived that she had a body like theirs , and that she continued to rise higher and higher out of the foam . "" Where am I ? "" asked she , and her voice sounded ethereal , as the voice of those who were with her ; no earthly music could imitate it . "" Among the daughters of the air , "" answered one of them . "" A mermaid has not an immortal soul , nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being . On the power of another hangs her eternal destiny . But the daughters of the air , although they do not possess an immortal soul , can , by their good deeds , procure one for themselves . We fly to warm countries , and cool the sultry air that destroys mankind with the pestilence . We carry the perfume of the flowers to spread health and restoration . After we have striven for three hundred years to all the good in our power , we receive an immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind . You , poor little mermaid , have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing ; you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit-world by your good deeds ; and now , by striving for three hundred years in the same way , you may obtain an immortal soul . "" The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun , and felt them , for the first time , filling with tears . On the ship , in which she had left the prince , there were life and noise ; she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her ; sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam , as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves . Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride , and fanned the prince , and then mounted with the other children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether . "" After three hundred years , thus shall we float into the kingdom of heaven , "" said she . "" And we may even get there sooner , "" whispered one of her companions . "" Unseen we can enter the houses of men , where there are children , and for every day on which we find a good child , who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love , our time of probation is shortened . The child does not know , when we fly through the room , that we smile with joy at his good conduct , for we can count one year less of our three hundred years . But when we see a naughty or a wicked child , we shed tears of sorrow , and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial ! """,8,8
"Stem cells are notable for being fecund -- they continually generate new cells . So too do cancer cells , however . Indeed , stem cells and cancer cells are beginning to seem very close relations . In one recent study , adult stem cells ( those obtained from mature animals , rather than early embryos ) were found to develop into tumour cell lines when grown in the laboratory . A team from Spain collected stem cells from fat tissue and grew them in culture for eight months . Some developed into cells that generated cancers when injected into animals . In a second study , a Danish team found that permanently activating telomerase in similar stem cells also made them cancerous . Telomerase protects the ends of chromosomes , which usually wear away at every cell division . Telomerase can prolong the lifespan of a cultured cell line , but leaves it vulnerable to uncontrolled proliferation . Studies of certain cells obtained from breast cancers are also disturbing . These cells can seed new breast cancers , and look very much like stem cells . Finally , Carla Bender Kim and colleagues recently identified a ' pocket ' in the adult mouse lung containing stem cells . As well as providing new lung epithelial cells , these cells can be triggered to proliferate by cancer-causing mutations . These and other studies highlight the perils as well as the potential of cellular immortality . They also raise questions about the use of adult stem cells in therapy . Rubio D et al.

"If Love Were All ! It was night , and I was in the cell wherein the King had lain in the Castle of Zenda . The great pipe that Rupert of Hentzau had nicknamed "" Jacob's Ladder "" was gone , and the lights in the room across the moat twinkled in the darkness . All was still ; the din and clash of strife were gone . I had spent the day hidden in the forest , from the time when Fritz had led me off , leaving Sapt with the princess . Under cover of dusk , muffled up , I had been brought to the Castle and lodged where I now lay . Though three men had died there – two of them by my hand – I was not troubled by ghosts . I had thrown myself on a pallet by the window , and was looking out on the black water ; Johann , the keeper , still pale from his wound , but not much hurt besides , had brought me supper . He told me that the King was doing well , that he had seen the princess ; that she and he , Sapt and Fritz , had been long together . Marshal Strakencz was gone to Strelsau ; Black Michael lay in his coffin , and Antoinette de Mauban watched by him ; had I not heard , from the chapel , priests singing mass for him ? Outside there were strange rumours afloat . Some said that the prisoner of Zenda was dead ; some , that he had vanished yet alive ; some , that he was a friend who had served the King well in some adventure in England ; others , that he had discovered the Duke's plots , and had therefore been kidnapped by him . One or two shrewd fellows shook their heads and said only that they would say nothing , but they had suspicions that more was to be known than was known , if Colonel Sapt would tell all he knew . Thus Johann chattered till I sent him away and lay there alone , thinking , not of the future , but – as a man is wont to do when stirring things have happened to him – rehearsing the events of the past weeks , and wondering how strangely they had fallen out . And above me , in the stillness of the night , I heard the standards flapping against their poles , for Black Michael's banner hung there half-mast high , and above it the royal flag of Ruritania , floating for one night more over my head . Habit grows so quick , that only by an effort did I recollect that it floated no longer for me . Presently Fritz von Tarlenheim came into the room . I was standing then by the window ; the glass was opened , and I was idly fingering the cement which clung to the masonry where "" Jacob's Ladder "" had been . He told me briefly that the King wanted me , and together we crossed the drawbridge and entered the room that had been Black Michael's . The King was lying there in bed ; our doctor from Tarlenheim was in attendance on him , and whispered to me that my visit must be brief . The King held out his hand and shook mine . Fritz and the doctor withdrew to the window . I took the King's ring from my finger and placed it on his . "" I have tried not to dishonour it , sire , "" said I. "" I ca n't talk much to you , "" he said , in a weak voice . "" I have had a great fight with Sapt and the Marshal – for we have told the Marshal everything . I wanted to take you to Strelsau and keep you with me , and tell everyone of what you had done ; and you would have been my best and nearest friend , Cousin Rudolf . But they tell me I must not , and that the secret must be kept – if kept it can be . "" "" They are right , sire . Let me go . My work here is done . "" "" Yes , it is done , as no man but you could have done it . When they see me again , I shall have my beard on ; I shall – yes , faith , I shall be wasted with sickness . They will not wonder that the King looks changed in face . Cousin , I shall try to let them find him changed in nothing else . You have shown me how to play the King . "" "" Sire , "" said I. "" I can take no praise from you . It is by the narrowest grace of God that I was not a worse traitor than your brother . "" He turned inquiring eyes on me ; but a sick man shrinks from puzzles , and he had no strength to question me . His glance fell on Flavia's ring , which I wore . I thought he would question me about it ; but , after fingering it idly , he let his head fall on his pillow . "" I do n't know when I shall see you again , "" he said faintly , almost listlessly . "" If I can ever serve you again , sire , "" I answered . His eyelids closed . Fritz came with the doctor . I kissed the King's hand , and let Fritz lead me away . I have never seen the King since . Outside , Fritz turned , not to the right , back towards the drawbridge , but to the left , and without speaking led me upstairs , through a handsome corridor in the chateau . "" Where are we going ? "" I asked . Looking away from me , Fritz answered : "" She has sent for you . When it is over , come back to the bridge . I 'll wait for you there . "" "" What does she want ? "" said I , breathing quickly . He shook his head . "" Does she know everything ? "" "" Yes , everything . "" He opened a door , and gently pushing me in , closed it behind me . I found myself in a drawing-room , small and richly furnished . At first I thought that I was alone , for the light that came from a pair of shaded candles on the mantelpiece was very dim . But presently I discerned a woman's figure standing by the window . I knew it was the princess , and I walked up to her , fell on one knee , and carried the hand that hung by her side to my lips . She neither moved nor spoke . I rose to my feet , and , piercing the gloom with my eager eyes , saw her pale face and the gleam of her hair , and before I knew , I spoke softly : "" Flavia ! "" She trembled a little , and looked round . Then she darted to me , taking hold of me . "" Do n't stand , do n't stand ! No , you must n't ! You 're hurt ! Sit down – here , here ! "" She made me sit on a sofa , and put her hand on my forehead . "" How hot your head is , "" she said , sinking on her knees by me . Then she laid her head against me , and I heard her murmur : "" My darling , how hot your head is ! "" Somehow love gives even to a dull man the knowledge of his lover's heart . I had come to humble myself and pray pardon for my presumption ; but what I said now was : "" I love you with all my heart and soul ! "" For what troubled and shamed her ? Not her love for me , but the fear that I had counterfeited the lover as I had acted the King , and taken her kisses with a smothered smile . "" With all my life and heart , "" said I , as she clung to me . "" Always , from the first moment I saw you in the Cathedral ! There has been but one woman in the world to me – and there will be no other . But God forgive me the wrong I 've done you ! "" "" They made you do it ! "" she said quickly ; and she added , raising her head and looking in my eyes : "" It might have made no difference if I 'd known it . It was always you , never the King ! "" "" I meant to tell you , "" said I. "" I was going to on the night of the ball in Strelsau , when Sapt interrupted me . After that , I could n't – I could n't risk losing you before – before – I must ! My darling , for you I nearly left the King to die ! "" "" I know , I know ! What are we to do now , Rudolf ? "" I put my arm round her and held her up while I said : "" I am going away tonight . "" "" Ah , no , no ! "" she cried . "" Not tonight ! "" "" I must go tonight , before more people have seen me . And how would you have me stay , sweetheart , except – ? "" "" If I could come with you ! "" she whispered very low . "" My God ! "" said I roughly , "" do n't talk about that ! "" and I thrust her a little back from me . "" Why not ? I love you . You are as good a gentleman as the King ! "" Then I was false to all that I should have held by . For I caught her in my arms and prayed her , in words that I will not write , to come with me , daring all Ruritania to take her from me . And for a while she listened , with wondering , dazzled eyes . But as her eyes looked on me , I grew ashamed , and my voice died away in broken murmurs and stammerings , and at last I was silent . She drew herself away from me and stood against the wall , while I sat on the edge of the sofa , trembling in every limb , knowing what I had done – loathing it , obstinate not to undo it . So we rested a long time . "" I am mad ! "" I said sullenly . "" I love your madness , dear , "" she answered . Her face was away from me , but I caught the sparkle of a tear on her cheek . I clutched the sofa with my hand and held myself there . "" Is love the only thing ? "" she asked , in low , sweet tones that seemed to bring a calm even to my wrung heart . "" If love were the only thing , I would follow you – in rags , if need be – to the world's end ; for you hold my heart in the hollow of your hand ! But is love the only thing ? "" I made no answer . It gives me shame now to think that I would not help her . She came near me and laid her hand on my shoulder . I put my hand up and held hers . "" I know people write and talk as if it were . Perhaps , for some , Fate lets it be . Ah , if I were one of them ! But if love had been the only thing , you would have let the King die in his cell . "" I kissed her hand . "" Honour binds a woman too , Rudolf . My honour lies in being true to my country and my House . I do n't know why God has let me love you ; but I know that I must stay . "" Still I said nothing ; and she , pausing a while , then went on : "" Your ring will always be on my finger , your heart in my heart , the touch of your lips on mine . But you must go and I must stay . Perhaps I must do what it kills me to think of doing . "" I knew what she meant , and a shiver ran through me . But I could not utterly fail her . I rose and took her hand . "" Do what you will , or what you must , "" I said . "" I think God shows His purposes to such as you . My part is lighter ; for your ring shall be on my finger and your heart in mine , and no touch save of your lips will ever be on mine . So , may God comfort you , my darling ! "" There struck on our ears the sound of singing . The priests in the chapel were singing masses for the souls of those who lay dead . They seemed to chant a requiem over our buried joy , to pray forgiveness for our love that would not die . The soft , sweet , pitiful music rose and fell as we stood opposite one another , her hands in mine . "" My queen and my beauty ! "" said I. "" My lover and true knight ! "" she said . "" Perhaps we shall never see one another again . Kiss me , my dear , and go ! "" I kissed her as she bade me ; but at the last she clung to me , whispering nothing but my name , and that over and over again – and again – and again ; and then I left her . Rapidly I walked down to the bridge . Sapt and Fritz were waiting for me . Under their directions I changed my dress , and muffling my face , as I had done more than once before , I mounted with them at the door of the Castle , and we three rode through the night and on to the breaking day , and found ourselves at a little roadside station just over the border of Ruritania . The train was not quite due , and I walked with them in a meadow by a little brook while we waited for it . They promised to send me all news ; they overwhelmed me with kindness – even old Sapt was touched to gentleness , while Fritz was half unmanned . I listened in a kind of dream to all they said . "" Rudolf ! Rudolf ! Rudolf ! "" still rang in my ears – a burden of sorrow and of love . At last they saw that I could not heed them , and we walked up and down in silence , till Fritz touched me on the arm , and I saw , a mile or more away , the blue smoke of the train . Then I held out a hand to each of them . "" We are all but half-men this morning , "" said I , smiling . "" But we have been men , eh , Sapt and Fritz , old friends ? We have run a good course between us . "" "" We have defeated traitors and set the King firm on his throne , "" said Sapt . Then Fritz von Tarlenheim suddenly , before I could discern his purpose or stay him , uncovered his head and bent as he used to do , and kissed my hand ; and as I snatched it away , he said , trying to laugh : "" Heaven does n't always make the right men kings ! "" Old Sapt twisted his mouth as he wrung my hand . "" The devil has his share in most things , "" said he . The people at the station looked curiously at the tall man with the muffled face , but we took no notice of their glances . I stood with my two friends and waited till the train came up to us . Then we shook hands again , saying nothing ; and both this time – and , indeed , from old Sapt it seemed strange – bared their heads , and so stood still till the train bore me away from their sight . So that it was thought some great man travelled privately for his pleasure from the little station that morning ; whereas , in truth it was only I , Rudolf Rassendyll , an English gentleman , a cadet of a good house , but a man of no wealth nor position , nor of much rank . They would have been disappointed to know that . Yet had they known all they would have looked more curiously still . For , be I what I might now , I had been for three months a King , which , if not a thing to be proud of , is at least an experience to have undergone . Doubtless I should have thought more of it , had there not echoed through the air , from the towers of Zenda that we were leaving far away , into my ears and into my heart the cry of a woman's love – "" Rudolf ! Rudolf ! Rudolf ! "" Hark ! I hear it now !",8,8
"Riot: Free players should be able to ""be successful and reach their maximum potential from a competitive standpoint"" Riot's new eCommerce Directory, Hippalus, has written a lengthy blog post on the League of Legends' forums detailing exactly how the company is approaching the sale of virtual goods within the game, and exactly what you can get for your money. It's not a change in how the company does its business in terms of League of Legends, but it's clarifying something that was worth clearing up. And more importantly, it's going to inform any future decisions in terms of pricing and promotions. The major point that Hippalus emphasised is that ""playing LoL should be super fun for players who don't spend money, ever. This means that players can experience a wide variety of play styles without purchasing anything, and can also be successful and reach their maximum potential from a competitive standpoint."" It's a pretty powerful statement to make, especially when the company's entire income comes from the players that do pay, rather than the ones that don't. To push so much forward without asking anything in return is generous, to say the least. The counterpoint is that they have to make those who do pay feel the investment is worth it. ""Players who support Riot by buying and spending RP should be rewarded with additional customization and be able to leverage their time more effectively. It is not cheap to support the most played game in the world, hire the best game dev talent, and release new content and functionality every week, and we are grateful to those who help us make that happen."" So far, I'd say that they've met both those criteria pretty well, making the like of skins and ease-of-use items the only difference between paid and unpaid players. That you can, theoretically, complete the champion roster and finish off all rune pages without ever laying down a penny is an impressive feat, and one that has no doubt contributed to make League of Legends such a behemoth of the free to play scene. More immediately important is that for the next six days, the bonus RP you get for buying in bulk is being doubled, as well as a new _2.50 option in the store, which buys you 400 RP. So if you were thinking of buying some, now might be the time. ",4,4
"Changing ISP re Broadband - what happens to email? When you change your ISP - what happens to your email address -does it just get 'taken over ' by the new ISP? I am about to change and I just have this feeling that my email is going to be an issue. The person who is arranging the changing over reckons I do not have to do anything? Would I not have to change my pop3 and smtp setting at least? ( I am going from Vodafone to Telecom - no horror stories please! ) Sign up for a free GMail account and tell everyone that is your new address BEFORE you switch. Avoid using the Xtra email address other than for ISP communications. You can probably keep your vodafone email but they will charge you for the privilege (probably $5 per month). geek_sighkick Mar 26, 2010, 9:04 pm #3 it is not really a vodafone email. I was with wave - they got taken over by ihug - then they got taken over by vodafone. The email address has stayed the same and just hopped from one place to another. It was with Telecom once too. too hard to change my email address that I have had for over 12 years. geek_honeybean Mar 26, 2010, 9:08 pm #4 and he told me there was no charge for the email. geek_honeybean Mar 26, 2010, 9:09 pm #5 oneybean Telecom (Xtra) and Vodafone are definitely not one and the same so it looks like you will have to pay Vodafone to keep the old address. You may be able to pay for simple re-direction to a Gmail account for say 3 months (or even more if you want) so it gives you time to sort out who you have to tell of your new email address. You can probably keep it forever providing you pay for the privilege. Set up a GMail to avoid any future disruptions. I have email addresses at GMail, Yahoo! , Hotmail Live, World-Net (ISP), free.net.nz, raider.co.nz and a couple on my own mail server attached to my Domain. I used dial-up (raider) and broadband. geek_sighkick Mar 26, 2010, 9:15 pm #6 but I do not pay anybody for my email address now. I just pay for broadband. I do not want to use Gmail - I want the emails in my computer (windows mail) So are you telling me the Telecom man was telling me porkies? geek_honeybean Mar 26, 2010, 9:20 pm #7 You can still have emails in your computer with gmail. I get mine forwarded to my actrix account, from gmail. The advantage is, there's always a copy left on gmail, and I can read and write gmail from my cheap cell phone. geek_chito Mar 26, 2010, 9:25 pm #8 you do pay for e-mail = you pay for broadband. There is a fee to keep your current e-mail active geek_jancemord Mar 26, 2010, 9:33 pm #9 so Telecom man was careful not to tell me that ? Surely somebody else has changed from Vodafone to Telecom - can you tell me what happened re your email address? ? ? ? geek_honeybean Mar 26, 2010, 9:35 pm #10 oneybean Yes, the email is FREE as part of your broadband deal. If you sign up to XTRA you get a free XTRA account i. e. honeybean@xtra.co.nz If you stay with Vodafone, you keep your OLD email. You can't expect XTRA (Telecom) to let you use your old vodafone email on XTRA. Yes, it is free, but only with the people you pay for your internet. So, if you want to keep your old email, you WILL have to pay a nominal monthly fee to Vodafone. You will automaticallly get a DIFFERENT free email account when you sign up with Telecom / Xtra. Having a GMail account gives you one constant that will last 50 years if you like and it is not subject to any changes you make with your ISP. No-one is telling you porkies, it's just that you are not asking the right questions. Ask Telecom if you can keep your OLD vodafone email on their servers for free! geek_sighkick Mar 26, 2010, 9:40 pm #11 I hate webmail accounts! ! Have a gmail account but never use it. I want my email to come to my inbox as it has done for 12 years. Going to ask some questions - I can still cancel theTelecom deal. only went for it because for$5 more I was getting4 times the amount of broadband usage. If I have to pay Vodafone for my email so be it - but the problem is you never get a straight answer out of these people! ! ! I have the Telecom mans cell phone number- I shall bug him on Monday! ! :-) geek_honeybean Mar 26, 2010, 9:54 pm #12 oneybean The point is YOU CAN GET GMAIL TO COME DIRECTLY TO YOUR COMPUTER. I do it myself. What's more... . you get an encrypted (read private) connection with Gmail. Also, it is FREE and the only service that is both FREE, can be used as Webmail but also you can collect it on your own computer with Outlook Express or similar just like you are used to. It takes a little setting up but is not impossible. I have suggested paying Vodafone to keep your mail active for a few months as you migrate to Gmail (you can have BOTH being collected by one copy of Outlook Express (I use Mozilla Thunderbird). I am a degreed Computer Tech and run my own Web and Mail servers so actually know what I am talking about. geek_sighkick Mar 26, 2010, 9:59 pm #13 ffs... ... . . just do the switch you'll lose the voda email acct and gain a telecom one however jsut do a mass email to all your contacts tellign them of the new addy... ... how hard is that ? geek_drcspy Mar 26, 2010, 10:01 pm #14 oneybean, I have done exactly what you are thinking of doing. After 12 years with ihug/vodafone I moved to xtra last Wednesday. I will keep my 3 ihug email address for awhile. As default all ihug email, along with xtra email, downloads to my inbox at the same time using the xtra pop settings. With configuration I can send email using my main ihug email address, using the xtra smtp settings. The other two I haven't bothered configuring and have to connect to ihug if I want to send messages using these addresses. The changeover has been seamless. A mailout advising the new addresses has seen all but two out of 20 emails have come in on the new address since the change. I must admit getting username@xtra to replace username@ihug has made it easier. Only problem I have had is getting the network to work through the router which is work in progress. I considered gmail but have been happy with ISP based email service and don't plan on changing again. geek_sleuth Mar 26, 2010, 10:05 pm #15 the point that annoys me is the Telecom man did not answer my question about the email when I asked him and asked him. he just said he had 'never heard of wave' . and ' I would not need to change anything - not even my email settings'Yeah right. I like facts and straight facts. Changing your email address after 12 years isa big deal as far as I am concerned and I am not prepared to do it. Thanks sleuth for your info. What do you pay for your ihug emails to keep them ? ? geek_honeybean Mar 26, 2010, 10:22 pm #16 I have been on dialup all these years (yes - there were still some of us left). Paid $20 per month. I think the point I am trying to make honeybean is that it has not been anywhere near the problem I thought it might have been. I will keep the ihug addresses for a few months to see how it goes. Have changed most of my subscriptions (like trademe, facebook, flybuys, etc plus banks etc ) over to the xtra address. (took about an hour) Will catch up on the rest as they come to light. I really think the ihug email will be redundant sooner rather than later. geek_sleuth Mar 26, 2010, 10:38 pm #17 If you have a wave.co.nz account then it is cleared from their server and you can use it with any ISP. Ignore the stupid twits who posted above. The only change you make is to the sending of email server, use send. xtra.co.nz, SSL, with authentication on port 465. You also need to go to the yahoo bubble crap and add the wave account and verify it as otherwise the Xtra smtp server will not send emails originating from wave.co.nz. spyware, what you have said is more or less what I have said. The thing is wether honeybean wants to totally and exclusivelykeep the wave address or slowly migrate over time to an extra address. If the later then he will need to use the POP3. xtra.co.nz setting to use both. I have that POP setting but can also send using username@ihug???. Just needs configuring through Yahoo Pro Mail geek_sleuth Mar 26, 2010, 11:01 pm #20 I want to see you SEND (smtp) via a Telecom (Xtra/Yahoo) account using your Vodafone/Wave credentials. Yes, you can POP3 (collect mail) from anywhere using the one ISP but all your outgoing mail will have the credentials of the ISP through which you are going. So your replies to your Wave account will come from an Xtra/Yahoo account. The only way around this is to make the Reply To: address match the account you are using. I am not familiar with Yahoo Pro mail - is it something you have to pay extra for or is it included with your Xtra Broadband connection. ",0,0
"Arboretum service marks Suez canal zone ceasefire A national event to remember the loss of 450 British military casualties in Suez , Egypt , has been held . More than 100 members of the Suez Veterans' Association and their families took part in a service at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire . Wreaths were then laid at the Suez Memorial . The service was to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the ceasefire in the Suez canal zone . A spokesman said the veterans had commented on the anniversary's importance and recognising the service of their comrades . The military was sent to Egypt to defend British interests in the Suez Canal , an important shipping link . The military was sent to Egypt to defend British interests in the Suez Canal in 1951 . The canal , which runs through Egypt , remains an important shipping link between Africa and Asia , and Britain at the time already had a military presence in the area . But tensions with Egypt and a rise in nationalism in the area led to the declaration of an emergency period until 1954 and military action , by Israel , Britain and France began in 1956 as they tried to maintain Western control . It ultimately failed .",4,1
"Less Politeness, More Forthrightness Watch out -- the Federal Observer brings you another thought provoking rant from a member of its Granny Brigade. Maybe that is the problem in this nation -- let's turn it over to the Grannys and let them straighten it all out. (JB) What happens when you yell and scream and finally get the attention of the law makers and lo and behold actually get a bill passed into law that will help save this country? Are you ready to do your part to make it work? Evidently not the people in Georgia! Or I suspect anywhere.... Headlines scream Farms falling into ruin... no workers? Well duhhhhhhhhh..... WHY? New immigration laws working too well? Crops sitting in the fields rotting not in the packing houses being shipped. Farmers losing their income, people losing their groceries! Oh yes we want to send the illegals home and save all of those empty dollars we give them every day, stop all the medical costs, all the housing etc... I yelled as much as anyone and know it is the right thing to do but are you ready for the results? We Americans have no intention of lowering ourselves to go into the fields like a wetback or migrant or what ever you want to call them... We want the products, the farmer wants the produce to sell, and the merchants need the produce but how do you get them without breaking a sweat or getting a little dirt under those manicured nails? Cut off the welfare and food stamps to the Americans... let them earn their keep for a change also.. it is not just the illegals smothering us all with their laziness and worthlessness. It isn't just the blacks it isn't just the foreigners there are just as many white bums out there as any race creed or color.... In all it is a American Problem... Too many hand outs, too many liberal voters, too many nanny state promoters.. well someone has to make that nanny state available and who better than the people who do have a backbone and are trying to take care of themselves.. The middle class has become the foster parents to the lazy, incompetent and brain dead, crack showing idiots that we just allow to take and take and take from us. As long as there are jobs of any kind, any pay scale, there should be no welfare, no help what so ever. Let the over weight bloated couch potatoes get off their butts and learn how to work for a change or starve. Have you noticed at the grocery stores that 90% of the food stamp users are hugely over weight? If they had to work for those food stamp dollars I bet some of that blubber would come off. You yell and scream moan and groan about no jobs yet there are thousands of them out there waiting for someone who really wants to work not just talk about it. Actually there aren't very many Americans that could do the work, maybe a little each day but to put in a full day of actual work? Not going to be easy and the Americans I know want everything easy. Clean... Quick... without effort just push a button or flick a switch. Well folks the time has come.. you will have to put your petty pride and laziness aside and get out and start doing what your ancestors did and learn to do it well. Hell no you had rather make minimum wage at McDonald's rather than get a good tan, build muscles and get healthy. You had rather sit in the air conditioning and punch little buttons on the cash registers or dump tons of potatoes into that nasty grease. Instead of buying your kids new IPODS etc drive them out to the farm and tell them to earn it.. Oh I know how lazy they are but if you are persistent and can find a farmer willing to put up with their whining and BS they may just learn the value of a dollar and respect you a little more. They would respect you allot more if you started being a parent instead of a friend also.. that means whacking a butt here and there when they are out of line.. not allowing the disrespect and demanding of a spoiled ingrate. that requires you to be a sensible adult also, one with respect for yourself and your country. Can you do that? People hate to hear ""When I was a kid"" etc but never the less when I was a kid every one of us knew that come the summer time we would have to bust our butts to get the things we wanted. We always had free time but also had jobs to do around the house, help in the garden, help in the kitchen, work in tobacco, pull weeds, string beans, peal apples, all to just make sure we ate the next winter.. Then we could also work for money when needed to pick berries, tomatoes, peppers, apples all by the basket.. I paid for all of my school clothes by the time I was 14 years old and I had nice clothes. I took care of them because I had worked so hard to get them. Where is our pride? Where is our desire to do things for ourselves? Had you rather stand in a line and get your free food stamps, your WIC cards, your welfare check, wow that is really hard work.. keeping your pride and dignity while standing in those lines with those judgmental government workers looking at your every secret. Judging you with their 9th grade education. ( It doesn't matter if they graduated with a masters they still only have a 9th grade education compared to what it should have been) Farmers will have to learn to farm the old ways too, give up those million dollar tractors, go back to the ones with no air conditioning, no stereos, just the functional equipment to get the job done. Can you imagine paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a harvester to use just once a year? How was it done in the past? Someone needs to start looking backwards. Folks with the devastation of our marketing farm products will come a better future.. Maybe we can get Monsanto out of farming along with the USDA and go back to the smaller family farms where the family works the land and profits from it for themselves not to support the corporations. It can be done.. It will just take some bravery and determination along with a big serving of PRIDE in yourselves.. Pride in your work,,,, Pride in your home and family. Pride in your country.

"Slow , lad , slow ,  he said . "" They might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry . "" Very deliberately , then , did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade , and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped . "" You 'll make a note of this here also , doctor , "" says he , "" and the boy 'll tell you how I saved his life , and were deposed for it too , and you may lay to that . Doctor , when a man 's steering as near the wind as me -- playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body , like--you would n't think it too much , mayhap , to give him one good word ? You 'll please bear in mind it 's not my life only now--it 's that boy 's into the bargain ; and you 'll speak me fair , doctor , and give me a bit o ' hope to go on , for the sake of mercy . "" Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house ; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in , his voice trembled ; never was a soul more dead in earnest . "" Why , John , you 're not afraid ? "" asked Dr. Livesey . "" Doctor , I 'm no coward ; no , not I--not SO much ! "" and he snapped his fingers . "" If I was I would n't say it . But I 'll own up fairly , I 've the shakes upon me for the gallows . You 're a good man and a true ; I never seen a better man ! And you 'll not forget what I done good , not any more than you 'll forget the bad , I know . And I step aside--see here--and leave you and Jim alone . And you 'll put that down for me too , for it 's a long stretch , is that ! "" So saying , he stepped back a little way , till he was out of earshot , and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle , spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight , sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and the house , from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast . "" So , Jim , "" said the doctor sadly , "" here you are . As you have brewed , so shall you drink , my boy . Heaven knows , I can not find it in my heart to blame you , but this much I will say , be it kind or unkind : when Captain Smollett was well , you dared not have gone off ; and when he was ill and could n't help it , by George , it was downright cowardly ! "" I will own that I here began to weep . "" Doctor , "" I said , "" you might spare me . I have blamed myself enough ; my life's forfeit anyway , and I should have been dead by now if Silver had n't stood for me ; and doctor , believe this , I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is torture . If they come to torture me -- "" "" Jim , "" the doctor interrupted , and his voice was quite changed , "" Jim , I ca n't have this . Whip over , and we 'll run for it . "" "" Doctor , "" said I , "" I passed my word . "" "" I know , I know , "" he cried . "" We ca n't help that , Jim , now . I 'll take it on my shoulders , holus bolus , blame and shame , my boy ; but stay here , I can not let you . Jump ! One jump , and you 're out , and we 'll run for it like antelopes . "" "" No , "" I replied ; "" you know right well you would n't do the thing yourself--neither you nor squire nor captain ; and no more will I. Silver trusted me ; I passed my word , and back I go . But , doctor , you did not let me finish .

This Convention does not exclude the exercise of any criminal jurisdiction established by a State Party in accordance with its national law . Article 10 Upon receiving information that an offence set forth in article 2 has been committed or is being committed in the territory of a State Party or that a person who has committed or who is alleged to have committed such an offence may be present in its territory , the State Party concerned shall take such measures as may be necessary under its national law to investigate the facts contained in the information .

Those authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any other offence of a grave nature under the law of that State . Whenever a State Party is permitted under its national law to extradite or otherwise surrender one of its nationals only upon the condition that the person will be returned to that State to serve the sentence imposed as a result of the trial or proceeding for which the extradition or surrender of the person was sought , and this State and the State seeking the extradition of the person agree with this option and other terms they may deem appropriate , such a conditional extradition or surrender shall be sufficient to discharge the obligation set forth in paragraph 1 of the present article . Article 12 Any person who is taken into custody or regarding whom any other measures are taken or proceedings are carried out pursuant to this Convention shall be guaranteed fair treatment , including enjoyment of all rights and guarantees in conformity with the law of the State in the territory of which that person is present and applicable provisions of international law , including international law of human rights . Article 13 The offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any extradition treaty existing between any of the States Parties before the entry into force of this Convention . States Parties undertake to include such offences as extraditable offences in every extradition treaty to be subsequently concluded between them . When a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty , the requested State Party may , at its option , consider this Convention as a legal basis for extradition in respect of the offences set forth in article 2 . Extradition shall be subject to the other conditions provided by the law of the requested State . States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offences set forth in article 2 as extraditable offences between themselves , subject to the conditions provided by the law of the requested State . If necessary , the offences set forth in article 2 shall be treated , for the purposes of extradition between States Parties , as if they had been committed not only in the place in which they occurred but also in the territory of the States that have established jurisdiction in accordance with article 9 , paragraphs 1 and 2 . The provisions of all extradition treaties and arrangements between States Parties with regard to offences set forth in article 2 shall be deemed to be modified as between States Parties to the extent that they are incompatible with this Convention . Article 14 States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with investigations or criminal or extradition proceedings brought in respect of the offences set forth in article 2 , including assistance in obtaining evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings . States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 of the present article in conformity with any treaties or other arrangements on mutual legal assistance that may exist between them . In the absence of such treaties or arrangements , States Parties shall afford one another assistance in accordance with their national law . Article 15 None of the offences set forth in article 2 shall be regarded , for the purposes of extradition or mutual legal assistance , as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives . Accordingly , a request for extradition or for mutual legal assistance based on such an offence may not be refused on the sole ground that it concerns a political offence or an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives . Article 16 Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite or to afford mutual legal assistance if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for offences set forth in article 2 or for mutual legal assistance with respect to such offences has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion or that compliance with the request would cause prejudice to that person's position for any of these reasons . Article 17 A person who is being detained or is serving a sentence in the territory of one State Party whose presence in another State Party is requested for purposes of testimony , identification or otherwise providing assistance in obtaining evidence for the investigation or prosecution of offences under this Convention may be transferred if the following conditions are met : ( a ) The person freely gives his or her informed consent ; and ( b ) The competent authorities of both States agree , subject to such conditions as those States may deem appropriate . For the purposes of the present article : ( a ) The State to which the person is transferred shall have the authority and obligation to keep the person transferred in custody , unless otherwise requested or authorized by the State from which the person was transferred ; ( b ) The State to which the person is transferred shall without delay implement its obligation to return the person to the custody of the State from which the person was transferred as agreed beforehand , or as otherwise agreed , by the competent authorities of both States ; ( c ) The State to which the person is transferred shall not require the State from which the person was transferred to initiate extradition proceedings for the return of the person ; ( d ) The person transferred shall receive credit for service of the sentence being served in the State from which he was transferred for time spent in the custody of the State to which he was transferred . Unless the State Party from which a person is to be transferred in accordance with the present article so agrees , that person , whatever his or her nationality , shall not be prosecuted or detained or subjected to any other restriction of his or her personal liberty in the territory of the State to which that person is transferred in respect of acts or convictions anterior to his or her departure from the territory of the State from which such person was transferred . Article 18 Upon seizing or otherwise taking control of radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities , following the commission of an offence set forth in article 2 , the State Party in possession of it shall : ( a ) Take steps to render harmless the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility ; ( b ) Ensure that any nuclear material is held in accordance with applicable International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards ; and ( c ) Have regard to physical protection recommendations and health and safety standards published by the International Atomic Energy Agency . Upon the completion of any proceedings connected with an offence set forth in article 2 , or sooner if required by international law , any radioactive material , device or nuclear facility shall be returned , after consultations ( in particular , regarding modalities of return and storage ) with the States Parties concerned to the State Party to which it belongs , to the State Party of which the natural or legal person owning such radioactive material , device or facility is a national or resident , or to the State Party from whose territory it was stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained . 3 ( 1 ) Where a State Party is prohibited by national or international law from returning or accepting such radioactive material , device or nuclear facility or where the States Parties concerned so agree , subject to paragraph 3 ( 2 ) of the present article , the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall continue to take the steps described in paragraph 1 of the present article ; such radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall be used only for peaceful purposes . 3 ( 2 ) Where it is not lawful for the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities to possess them , that State shall ensure that they are as soon as possible placed in the possession of a State for which such possession is lawful and which , where appropriate , has provided assurances consistent with the requirements of paragraph 1 of the present article in consultation with that State , for the purpose of rendering it harmless ; such radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities shall be used only for peaceful purposes . If the radioactive material , devices or nuclear facilities referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the present article do not belong to any of the States Parties or to a national or resident of a State Party or was not stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained from the territory of a State Party , or if no State is willing to receive such item pursuant to paragraph 3 of the present article , a separate decision concerning its disposition shall , subject to paragraph 3 ( 2 ) of the present article , be taken after consultations between the States concerned and any relevant international organizations . For the purposes of paragraphs 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 of the present article , the State Party in possession of the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility may request the assistance and cooperation of other States Parties , in particular the States Parties concerned , and any relevant international organizations , in particular the International Atomic Energy Agency . States Parties and the relevant international organizations are encouraged to provide assistance pursuant to this paragraph to the maximum extent possible . The States Parties involved in the disposition or retention of the radioactive material , device or nuclear facility pursuant to the present article shall inform the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency of the manner in which such an item was disposed of or retained . The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency shall transmit the information to the other States Parties . In the event of any dissemination in connection with an offence set forth in article 2 , nothing in the present article shall affect in any way the rules of international law governing liability for nuclear damage , or other rules of international law . Article 19 The State Party where the alleged offender is prosecuted shall , in accordance with its national law or applicable procedures , communicate the final outcome of the proceedings to the Secretary-General of the United Nations , who shall transmit the information to the other States Parties . Article 20 States Parties shall conduct consultations with one another directly or through the Secretary-General of the United Nations , with the assistance of international organizations as necessary , to ensure effective implementation of this Convention . Article 21 The States Parties shall carry out their obligations under this Convention in a manner consistent with the principles of sovereign equality and territorial integrity of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States . Article 22 Nothing in this Convention entitles a State Party to undertake in the territory of another State Party the exercise of jurisdiction and performance of functions which are exclusively reserved for the authorities of that other State Party by its national law . Article 23 Any dispute between two or more States Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this Convention which can not be settled through negotiation within a reasonable time shall , at the request of one of them , be submitted to arbitration .

"The driver (on the ground with his arm in the air) of a white Suzuki which left the road south of the Chook and Filly restaurant in Maraekakaho escaped a head-on collision but didn't come away scot-free. Photo / Glenn Taylor A 29-year-old man whose car left the road on State Highway 50, Maraekakaho and crossed the centre line was lucky to avoid a head-on crash, police say. He was the only occupant in a white Suzuki which last night travelled 250-metres straddling an open drain on the wrong side of the road, before coming to a halt. He was heading towards Hastings when the accident occurred south of the Chook and Filly restaurant, just before 6pm. ""It looks like he has come off the road, come across without breaking, straddled a culvert then an open drain for some distance,"" Hastings Police Sergeant Kent Gilmore said. ""Luckily he avoided a head-on crash. Cars coming in the other direction saw him. It could have been a lot worse."" Damage to the underside of the car was thought to be quite extensive, as it scraped along the rocks. Police were yet to determine what caused the driver to veer off the road. The man was taken to Hawke's Bay Hospital by ambulance and was still being assessed in the emergency department when Hawke's Bay Today went to print. ",4,4
"Chocolate University Online Free Chocolate Information 21 things you must know about chocolate ! Chocolate is made from the fruit of the cacao tree . Cacao pods contain nibs that are crushed to make unsweetened chocolate . When the cacao nibs are crushed , there are fats and solids remaining . The fats are called cocoa butter . The solids are ground into cocoa powder . Chocolate bars may have "" % Cacao "" or "" % Cocoa "" printed on the label . This percentage refers to the total content of the cacao ( or cocoa ) solids . White Chocolate does not contain cocoa solids but can be called chocolate by U.S. FDA standards . It must contain cocoa butter . James Baker started America's first chocolate company in Dorchester , Massachusetts in 1765 , based on the advice of John Hannon , a penniless Irish immigrant . "" Fair Trade "" chocolate means farmers and laborers are paid a fair price for the product rather than being exploited . Products become Fair Trade Certified based on the standards determined by Fairtrade Labeling Organizations International . Organic chocolate is made from ingredients , including the cacao bean , that are grown without the use of synthetic pesticides or genetic modifications . In the US , the USDA must inspect a farm before its products can be labeled organic . The world's first chocolate candy was made by Dutch chocolate-maker Conrad Van Houten in 1828 . He pressed the fat from roasted cacao beans to isolate the cocoa butter , and then added it to cocoa powder and sugar . It has been reported that Napoleon carried chocolate with him on his military campaigns , and ate it when he needed quick energy . ' Single-origin ' chocolate indicates that the cocoa beans used to produce the bar are from one region or country . In countries like Ghana and Ivory Coast , people rarely eat chocolate because it is worth more to them as a trade product than as a food . Cacao is dried in the sun for about 7 days before shipped from the country of origin to the chocolate manufacturer . The largest cacao producing countries are Côte d ' Ivoire , Ghana , and Indonesia . Chocolate Liquor is the ground up "" nib "" of the cocoa bean . Fermentation is an important step in the transformation of cacao beans to chocolate . Now that you 've had a taste of chocolate information , would you like even more trivia ?

"Brainstorming Software : Ideafisher Morphs Into Thoughtoffice ThoughtOffice is latest step in the evolution of business creativity solutions that began with IdeaFisher . Portland , OR , ( PRAvenueNW ) -- IdeaFisher came first . It caused quite a stir when it was introduced years ago as a way to bring brainstorming to the personal computer . ThoughtOffice is latest step in the evolution of business creativity solutions that began with IdeaFisher . It adds to Marsh Fisher's original vision a multimedia and web-savvy approach to computerized brainstorming . Marsh may not have fully anticipated the Internet but he saw the possibilities brainstorming software would unleash to creatives worldwide . As far back as the 1970s , Fisher , the founder of Century 21 , began looking for a computer software solution to the challenge of streamlining and improving the brainstorming process . Released in 1988 to critical acclaim , Fisher's breakthrough IdeaFisher ( http://www.thoughtoffice.com ) software quickly became the leading program in its category worldwide . ThoughtOffice , the pedigreed successor to IdeaFisher , was given its present name by Mark Effinger , an innovative "" multrepreneur , "" who developed around Marsh Fisher's program with the express purpose of adapting it to the new circumstances now at work in a computer environment shaped by the innovations of the Internet Age . Effinger added new features and functions to Marsh Fisher's principles and brought to it to market with access to the astonishing resources of the World Wide Web . ThoughtOffice not only built on the platform introduced by IdeaFisher but combined it with other creativity tools such as mindmapping and visual outlining ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=355 ) . According to Chuck Frey , founder of www.InnovationTools.com , "" ThoughtOffice will help you to take your creative problem-solving skills to the next level . "" Frey adds , "" ThoughtOffice does a great job of leveraging the power of associative thinking ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=325 ) . Using its rich , interconnected resources , you can follow a long trail of associations without running out of creative steam . Or you can follow a guided problem solving process to reveal fresh ideas and insights . In short , ThoughtOffice is like IdeaFisher on steroids . "" ThoughtOffice also makes ideas easy to understand and share with others -- employees , business associates , or clients -- whether in the same room , or across the web . Building on the original IdeaFisher process , one of the ThoughtOffice program's key functions is the IdeaBrowser , an exclusive brainstorming creativity engine that uses words , phrases , popular search engine phrases and images to help explore ideas quickly and easily . The program is integrated with ThoughtOffice , creating a hybrid of mind mapping and outlining capabilities in an easily accessible mini-browser that jump-starts the creative process . Frey also tells us , "" ThoughtOffice provides users with an unprecedented variety and volume of idea stimuli . It also succeeds in bringing together two different types of creative thinking ( http://www.thoughtoffice.com/?page_id=5 ) into one well-designed software program . Its question databases provide a solid foundation for left-brained , systematic problem definition , while its idea-generation tools serve as a catalyst to help the right half of your brain to make new associations and connections , which should lead to more breakthrough ideas . "" The ThoughtOffice programs , which range in price from $ 99 to $ 499 , address 17 distinct areas of expertise . What they have in common is the ability to harness the creative practices to productivity tools usually found only in separate programs . ThoughtOffice "" Bundles "" cover everything from Marketing and Advertising ( http://thoughtoffice.com/blog/?page_id=289 ) techniques to Effective Communication for live and written presentation . eXpertTopic Modules , which were developed with the use of a cadre of experts in creative fields , expand the core ThoughtOffice application and are targeted toward very specific Topics such as Conflict Resolution or Story & Screenplay Writing . The innovative successor to IdeaFisher works as an extension of the brain . Each is loaded with hundreds of questions that mine the subconscious for known and often-forgotten information -- and uncovers new connections through the kind of juxtaposition that lies at the heart of creativity . Advertising and PR consultant Martin Grossman ( http://marketingmatters.blogs.com/martin_grossman ) was early adopter of IdeaFisher and later a ThoughtOffice customer is convinced that ThoughtOffice is an indispensable tool for his practice . "" If creative types need to get their minds around a big , complicated project quickly , ThoughtOffice will help them do it faster and do it better , "" says Grossman . "" It 's the breakthrough in creativity software that people who think for a living have been waiting many years to see .

"Harvesting and Storing Herbs HARVESTING YOUR HERBS Harvesting herbs will promote new growth , so is to be encouraged . There are a few rules to ensure you get the best harvest possible : Always harvest from clean healthy plant material Flowering herbs are in their peak condition just before flowering so pick then , unless it 's the flowers you want Try and harvest herbs in the morning on a dry day and after the dew has done Annual herbs such as Coriander , Basil can usually be harvested two or three times in a season Perennial Herbs such as Rosemary , Sage after the first year can be harvested throughout the year Flowers for drying are usually picked in bud When harvesting roots it is not necessary to destroy the whole plant , just cut away what you need and replant the plant . PRESERVING YOUR HERBS There are several methods for preserving and storing Herbs that can easily be carried out at home , with little if any specialist equipment . Drying Herbs Herbs can be air dried , a technique used in many countries The ideal place is dry and well ventilated , free from dust and fumes An airing cupboard , an attic or under the eaves are all good places Do NOT dry herbs in the sun as this will evaporate all the precious volatile oils A constant temperature of 20o - 32o C is ideal Speed is of the essence NOTE : If the herbs turn black or go mouldy then throw them away as the drying process has failed and the herbs are not worth keeping Oven Drying Herbs Place clean and dry roots on a baking tray and dry at 50 o – 60o C for between 2-3 hours depending upon the amount and size of herbs you are drying Microwave Drying Care has to be taken when drying herbs in a microwave Generally it takes about 1-4 minutes to dry approximately 10 sprigs of herbs , depending upon the type of herb , small leaved herbs such as thyme take less time It is very easy to overcook herbs using this method NEVER dry Sage using this method as it ignites ! Storing Dried Herbs It is better to store dried herbs in a dark cupboard as light destroys the quality of the herb The shelf life of dried herbs is generally about 12 months , if they smell musty then throw them away NOTE : There are a number of purpose made Dehydrators that can be bought for drying all types of food . Herbs dry particularly well in these Freezing Herbs Freezing is an excellent method for storing herbs as it helps retain colour , flavour and nutritional content . There are two ways to freeze herbs : Place finely chopped herbs in an ice-cube tray and top up with water . Each ice cube hold about 1 tablespoon of herbs and a teaspoon of water NOTE : Individual herb flowers , such as borage , Lavender or leaves such as mint can all be frozen in individual cubes to add flavour and interest to summer drinks HERBAL OILS & VINEGARS Herbs have been preserved in oils and vinegars for centuries . Herb Oils and Vinegars can be used in salads , sauces , dressings and marinades . Herb Oils and Vinegars can be made with some basic equipment and can look attractive if you can find some old bottles to store the oils and vinegars . Herbal Oils Loosely fill a clean glass jar ( Kilner type is best ) with the herb of your choice and fill with good quality oil – olive or sunflower Strain the contents to remove the herbs and fill clean bottles , adding a sprig of the herb for identification , although it 's best to label and date as well A variety of herbs are suitable to make oils : Basil , Rosemary , Dill , Lemon Thyme , Fennel , Sage NOTE : Care must always be taken when making herbal oils as there is a risk of Botulism – a rare but serious form of food poisoning . If the herbs look mouldy in the oil , throw it away and start again . Herbal Vinegars Made in much the same way as the oils . It is best to first slightly crush the herbs before placing in the clean jar Never use a jar with a metal lid , as the vinegar will corrode the lid and this will taint the contents After two weeks , strain the herbs and place the vinegar in clean bottles , with a sprig of herb for identification",2,2

"A piece of heaven in Kerala Baby Mathew Vallikappen does! Together with his wife Rani, Baby owns Vanilla County Plantation, a charming home stay at the foot hills of Vagamon at Teekoy, Kerala, India. During a recent visit to India I have the good fortune to stay at Vanilla County and am lucky enough to be the recipient of Baby and Rani's gracious hospitality.  What is of particular interest to me is Baby's 'back to nature' vision for his spice and rubber plantation. I am keen  to learn more about his eco project. Baby and Rani Baby is the youngest of six sons and, as such, he inherited his father's home (Vanilla County). Here he grows vanilla, rubber,  coffee, black peppercorns, jackfruit, (all of which he sells commercially), as well as cocoa beans, nutmeg, tapioca, yams, cardamon, mace, vegetables such as eggplant,  turmeric, bananas, papaya, cinnamon, screwpine, cashew nuts, betel nuts, ginger, coconut and cloves ( which he keeps for his own use). These crops are grown on the very extensive grounds that surround his homestead and also on a plantation of 25 acres which is further up the road. On this acreage he grows 600 rubber trees which are interspersed with teak, mahogany, jackfruit, wildjack, banana and coconut trees.  He tells us that he could make a lot more money by solely growing rubber trees but he chooses to grow a variety of trees and spices in true eco style as he cares about nature. He tells us that this way he doesn't have to use pesticides as the companion plants he grows deter the pests and squirrels from attacking the rubber trees and the spices. His plantation is totally organic.  Cow dung is used for fertilizer and he grows lantana to attract butterflies. The Cardamon Flower Wildjack is used for making houseboats, teak and mahogany are valuable woods used to make furniture, and even rubber trees (after 20 years of rubber production) are used to make hardwood furniture. Baby shows us the rubber being tapped. One side of the tree is tapped over a period of 10 years, and then the other side is tapped for 10 years. Ten trees give one kilo of rubber milk per day or one sheet. However, straight after the monsoon season output increases to one kilo per day from one tree. The waste products of the rubber gathering process are used to make rubber bands. The rubber milk is mixed with formic acid and rolled into squares that look exactly like white rubber bath mats. These mats are hung to dry on a clothes line and the next day are smoked in his rubber smoking house.  I rather liked them when they were white bath mats but at the end of the smoking process they look like they are squares of ... yep, tyres! A little corner of Paradise He used to raise poultry but discovered what I already knew, ie that hens, in their never ending search for yummy worms and bugs, destroyed the roots of the vanilla plants.  My hens have gobbled up everything that I've ever tried to grow. The vanilla has to be hand pollinated as there is no natural pollinator in India. In Mexico, where vanilla originates, it is pollinated by a humming bird. I suppose we could say that this is one of the effects of taking something that flourishes in one land to another... but the story also draws attention to how little things like the fate of a humming bird, can be of paramount importance to the continuation of a species of plant (in this case, vanilla). I suppose it is lucky that the plants can be hand pollinated. Vanilla County Homestead Baby shows us a precarious-looking ladder which the pepper gatherer uses to collect the peppers as the vine twists around very tall trees. He shows us the peppercorns drying on sheets of paper. Baby tells that Vanilla County is a haven for bird watchers. Birds that can be seen here are the Eurasian Golden Oriole, the Red Vented Bulbul, the Rufous Treepie and the White Throated Kingfisher. When they have time, Baby and Rani unwind by swimming  in natural pools created by mountain streams. Would it be possible to find anything more heavenly? Baby and Rani have supplemented their income by turning their delightful plantation into a home stay and Rani uses her own spices in the food she cooks. She made us  two great curries (fish and beef) and some wonderful fluffy parotta bread. I just wish we could have stayed longer! But I certainly recommend Vanilla County to anyone who loves nature and really -- who wouldn't want to swim in a rock pool, nap in a garden hammock or eat home cooked Indian food? Believe me, this homestead is as close to heaven as you'll get! Fluffy Parotta (a very difficult dish to master) If only there were more farmers like Baby. In these days when crops are sprayed with dangerous chemicals and seeds are genetically modified, Baby's plantation is a wonderful example of traditional farming techniques. Tapping is commenced on rubber trees at a height of 50 inches from the base or bud union and the tree attains a girth of 20 inches at that height. Ideally tapping is done once in three days. The optimal consumption of bark is 7 inches per year (with rain guarding). Hence simple arithmetic shows that one side of the tree can be tapped for only 7 years. Thanks for your comment. I have passed it on to Baby who replies as follows- I read the comment. What he said is also correct. In theory it is true. Bur real farmers are more practical. We the farmers in this area start tapping at the height of 5 ft . So we can tapp for more years.. We tap once in 2 days. Some farmers tap once in 3 days.It depends upon the area. Hope it is clear. Regards, Baby --  What he said is also correct. In theory it is true. = Not in theory only, but in practice too But real farmers are more practical. = Please Baby, with 3 generations and 75 years of experience in planting, don't say we are not real farmers. Both of us know it. We the farmers in this area start tapping at the height of 5 ft. So we can tap for more years. = Practically good idea provided your tappers are tall enough. Tell me baby, do you commence tapping only when the girth attains 20 inches at 5 ft. (60 inches) or less because to attain a girt of 20 inches at 60 inches height you will have to wait for more years which prolongs your immature period. We tap once in 2 days. = Gosh.... If you tap on alternate days your intensity of tapping is more which means you must be consuming more bark than us who tap only once in three days. This again means less number of years on one side. Some farmers tap once in 3 days. It depends upon the area. = It is not depending on the area but rather on the recommendation of the Rubber Research Institute of India. I changed from once in two days to once in 3 days 20 years ago in 1990. Hope it is clear. = No, I am still confused by your estate management practices! There are many several countries for a fantastic family trip across the globe. I do not acknowledge why, but yet i do think i'm keen on mainly a asian continent meant for this vacation, simply because i think the people there are therefore friendly and also great ",5,5

"Keane - Silenced By The Night He says: ""One thing I regret about Perfect Symmetry and Night Train is that we weren't connecting, getting the emotions and stories across. I wanted those stories told clearly on this record."" There's been a greater emphasis on his lyrics with key songs such as the tender ballad and album's best track, The Starting Line, new single Silenced By The Night, the eerily beautiful Black Rain each telling a story about friendship, love and dreams. And Strangeland's centrepiece is Sovereign Light Cafe, a song that pays homage to the seafront caf in Bexhill, East Sussex, where they used to meet as teenagers. Richard says: ""I remember driving around in Tom's ropey green Honda. The freedom and kicking a football around."" But Tim stresses that rather than an album of pure nostalgia, it's about looking forward. qr He says: ""We are just getting started. I really think that even at this stage. Our determination to keep getting better has been inspired by us getting better as a band. We're not on cruise control and no one cares any more. That would terrify me."" And pre-show, SFTW finds the band in good spirits. Richard laughs as we walk into their dressing room: ""Close your eyes -- there are naked hockey players next door,"" The room doubles up as a changing room for the local ice hockey teams. New boy bassist Jesse Quin irons his shirt (""I bet U2 don't iron their own clothes,"" he jokes), while Tom drums the back of a chair with a pair of sticks. Tim is next door in their music room, rehearsing for showtime in exactly two hours. Strangeland is the sound of a band finally comfortable with their place in music. Later on back at the band's hotel, Tim says: ""I guess we are more confident. Making our previous records out of the Keane comfort zone (they experimented with synths and hip-hop) helped that for sure. Keane's fourth album ... out on May 7 ""One minute we were a piano band then we became a Euro synth band."" The tracks were recorded at Tim's SeaFog studios next to his Sussex home with Vaccines, Radiohead and Lana Del Rey producer Dan Grech-Marguerat. He spent most of 2010 writing them. Tim -- who has also written for Kylie Minogue, Nicole Scherzinger and Gwen Stefani -- admits: ""It took a bit longer than I'd hoped to unlock something that we all felt excited about. They are all stories you want to shine a light on."" He adds: ""For me it's the first time we've made something that touches on real greatness."" Jesse, 30, says: ""With this album Tim worked so hard. He'd write, then send tracks to the rest of us and wait for our reaction. ""We'd argue about some songs. ""And it's difficult because you know Tim's been sat in his studio slaving away, unlocking his soul and we go back to him, 'I don't like the line about... ' knowing he will be going, 'F*** Off.'"" There's been a lot of growing up for Keane in recent years. All members are now married and Tim has welcomed a second daughter. Keane also expanded by welcoming Jesse -- Tim's partner in Mt Desolation -- on board ""officially"" for Strangeland though he's played live with them since 2007. qr He laughs: ""I will be like Ronnie Wood -- the new guy for 30 years. I always thought someone was missing when Keane played live -- I never realised it was me."" Tim says: ""Jesse is a great person to bounce ideas off with all this effort going into the songs."" It's been quite the journey for the band from Battle -- all friends since school. Their 2004 debut Hopes and Fears was a massive hit and the spotlight affected the three band members differently. Richard says: ""The attention Tom got was scary. It wasn't about the fame -- we just wanted to be in a band."" Tim agrees: ""When we started we were typical teenagers who wanted to meet girls. A bunch of geeks who wanted to find a way of being cool."" ""Cool"" and ""Keane"" are not two words that go together. With their posh middle-class backgrounds, they've come in for sniping. Tom says: ""As a band I think we've suffered a lot of judgment. Richard adds: ""It was constant abuse for a while. But our fans have stuck with us and we're still here making the best music. And it's OK to like Keane now."" One famous fan is acclaimed Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez who made the cult 2007 movie The Orphanage. The band has just made a short horror film with him for their song Disconnected. And it was Glastonbury 2004 when the then trio first realised how big they had become. Tom explains: ""We came back from America where we'd played to 200 people in New York. One of our crew said, 'Oh there's a few in,' And we went out and there were more people than you could ever imagine -- 30,000 people."" Tim adds: ""It was a blur of adrenaline. I remember the noise and everyone singing. ""Having a number one album is great but it's just something on a piece of paper. Seeing thousands of people singing your songs is something else."" It's their lasting friendship and level-headedness which is their real strength. Jesse says: ""There's no egos in Keane. They've all got piles of platinum and gold discs in boxes in their garages. They don't want to show off. ""I had to convince Tim that it was acceptable for him to have his Ivor Novello and Brit Awards on show in his studio!"" Relaxed and enjoying life on the road, Keane are at a high point after some well-documented turbulent times. In 2006, Tom checked into the Priory for treatment for drink and drug problems. He says: ""I wasn't enjoying the gigs and I was really tired. ""I was having late nights, eating, drinking and the rest. Keane was grinding to a halt."" And Richard remembers 2005's Live 8 as one regret. He recalls: ""We left to go to another festival. Watching everyone singing with Macca at the end. Why weren't we there, arm in arm with our friends The Killers?"" The making of second album 2006's Under The Iron Sea was particularly fraught, with a breakdown of communication between Tom and Tim in particular. Tim frowns: ""It was pretty grim. After Hopes and Fears we had this incredible rush and didn't know what was going on. ""It was very dark. I remember thinking, 'How the hell are we going to pull through?' ""We were making that album close to Tom's and he'd still go missing. Things were getting worse. I could never find him. I would be banging on his door in the middle of the night which felt ludicrous."" Tim's feelings were vented through songs -- though Tim says he now understands more about Tom's struggles. He says: ""It was hard for him. We'd be at an airport at 7am and he'd have cameras thrust in his face. No asking or courtesy either."" And now?

"Tibbetts Brook , originally Tippett's Brook or Tibbitt's Brook , is a stream in the southern portion of mainland New York , flowing north to south from the city of Yonkers in Westchester County into the borough of the Bronx within New York City . Originally emptying into Spuyten Duyvil Creek as part of the Harlem River system , the stream is now partially subterranean , ending above ground at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake within Van Cortlandt Park . There it proceeds into city sewers , draining into either the northern end of the Harlem River or the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant . The brook provides significant watershed to both Van Cortlandt Park at its south end and Tibbetts Brook Park at its north end . There have been modern proposals to daylight the southern portion of the brook back onto the surface . Contents Top : The original course of Spuyten Duyvil Creek and its junction with Tibbetts Brook , and the island of Paparinemo ( now Kingsbridge , Bronx ) Bottom : An 1895 map of Van Cortlandt Park , showing the course of Tibbetts Brook through the park lake , and its original crossing point with Broadway . Tibbetts Brook originates at H.F. Redmond Junior Memorial Park just north of Yonkers Avenue in Dunwoodie , Yonkers . It proceeds south through two artificial lakes in Tibbetts Brook Park , on a course parallel and adjacent to the Saw Mill River Parkway and the former New York and Putnam Railroad ( now a park trail ) . South of the park the brook runs in a channel directly adjacent to the northbound side of the parkway , then crosses the Yonkers / Bronx border into Van Cortlandt Park . It runs through the center of the Van Cortlandt Golf Course , then empties into Van Cortlandt Lake , an artificial lake created in 1699 by damming the stream . The brook currently ends at the south edge of the lake , at approximately West 242nd Street . Several storm drains feed excess rainwater into the brook within Yonkers . At the brook's mouth , the water from the brook proceeds into a brick sewer tunnel , which later merges with the major city sewer underneath Broadway that carries rainwater , household wastewater , and industrial sewage . The tunnel primarily drains into the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant where city sewage is treated . During rainy conditions the sewer overflows into the north end of the Harlem River , via a drain pipe at about West 192nd Street ( Heath Avenue ) . Due to modern development , the brook runs through underpasses and culverts at various points along its course . As recently as the early 20th Century , Tibbets Brook had two northern tributaries which merged at the north end of modern Tibbets Brook Park . The easternmost began in Redmond Park , while the western stream extended as far as Runyon Heights . The two streams originally merged at Peckham's Lake , later converging at the lakes of Tibbets Brook Park following the completion of the park . The Saw Mill Parkway was built over the western stream in the late 1920s . Until the end of the 19th century , the brook extended past the south end of Van Cortlandt Park . It ran southwest through the site of the current Van Cortlandt Stadium , crossed Broadway at around West 240th Street , then continued southwest through the Kingsbridge neighborhood , running a twisty course along the right-of-way of modern Tibbett Avenue . At approximately West 230th Street , just north of the current site of John F. Kennedy High School , the brook drained into Spuyten Duyvil Creek , which at the time separated the Bronx from Marble Hill , Manhattan . Until the 1700s , Tibbets Brook split into two smaller streams at around West 237th Street , the westernmost and primary stream along modern Tibbett Avenue feeding into the Spuyten Duyvil , and the easternmost along the right-of-ways of the Putnam Railroad and current Major Deegan Expressway feeding into the Harlem River . The two streams formed a triangular island called Paparinemo that constitutes much of today's Kingsbridge neighborhood . The brook had numerous tributaries , including several within modern Van Cortlandt Park . The north end of the brook within Yonkers and the park is entirely fresh water , while south of the park it was a tidal estuary lined with salt marshes . The watershed from the brook created wetlands surrounding the stream , and formed a northern extension of the Harlem River valley . The original Spuyten Duyvil Creek course has since been filled in , replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal . An 1867 map of Yonkers and Western Bronx , showing the course of Tibbetts Brook ( in red ) prior to modern development . Tibbetts Brook was originally referred to as Mosholu by local Lenape Native Americans , an Algonquin word meaning "" smooth stones "" or "" small stones "" . The Mosholu name was later given to Mosholu Parkway . The label Tibbetts Brook was applied by European settlers , named after George Tippett who held property between the Hudson River and Bronx River in the late 17th Century , with the brook running through the center . Although often considered a corruption of the name Tippett , the label may be a combination of the name of Tippett and that of his father-in-law William Betts , who owned the land along with him . The brook has also been referred to as the Yonkers River or Yonkers Creek in the past , previously written as Jonckers or Uncas . During at least three glacial periods , including the Wisconsin glaciation around 20,000 years ago , ice sheets advanced south across North America carving moraines , valleys , and hills across present-day Bronx and Westchester . As the glacial ice melted , rivers and creeks were formed within valleys , including Tibbetts Brook . Prior to European colonization , the local Lenape population utilized the brook for drinking water and fishing . Trout swam up the Harlem River in order to use the freshwater portion of the brook as a spawning site . The salt marshes along the stream housed fish and migratory birds , along with mussels , oysters , and crabs . In the 1690s , Jacobus Van Cortlandt acquired property near Tibbetts Brook from his relative Frederick Philipse , located in modern Van Cortlandt Park . This area was called "" George's Point "" , where the brook turned west towards Broadway . In 1699 , Van Cortlandt dammed the stream in order to power a gristmill and sawmill , creating Van Cortlandt Lake as a mill pond in the process . By the 19th Century , the eastern stream was filled in , connecting Kingsbridge to the rest of the Bronx . From 1872 to 1880 , the New York and Putnam Railroad was built along the Tibbetts Brook valley . The construction of the railroad altered the natural drainage pattern of the brook , leading new marshes to develop around it . In 1888 , the New York City Parks Department acquired the land to create Van Cortlandt Park . The Parks Department began draining the brook wetlands for recreational areas , creating the park's parade ground in 1888 and the Van Cortlandt Golf Course in 1895 . The lake flows south into a drain pipe to the Broadway sewer Between the late 1890s and the early 1910s , around the time the original course of Spuyten Duyvil Creek was filled in and replaced by the Harlem River Ship Canal , the double-arched Broadway sewer was constructed , as was the tunnel at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake to funnel water from the brook into the sewer . The marshlands created by the brook and lake had drawn the ire of local residents and property owners , who believed them to be "" unsightly and unsanitary "" . Of particular concern was the threat of the wetlands serving as breeding grounds for malaria - borne mosquitoes . The Broadway Outlet Sewer was completed in 1907 . In conjunction with the sewer project , from 1903 to 1911 the Parks Department completed a cleaning and improvement project for the Van Cortlandt Lake . This involved removing the original earthen dam and emptying the lake in order to dredge the lake bed to a lower depth . A new dam was installed to reform the lake . The drain pipe between the lake and Broadway sewer was constructed from 1911 to 1912 . It was originally envisioned as cast-iron , but built using brick . Around this time , Tibbett Avenue was laid out and opened , while much of the marshland within the park and along the former river course was filled in . On June 25 , 1927 , Westchester County opened Tibbetts Brook Park near the northern end of the brook , on land previously confiscated from the Tippett estate . Much of the site had been a Yonkers city garbage dump located on the banks of the western brook tributary . The garbage and residential sewage seeped into the stream , which fed polluted water into Peckham's Lake . The lake had been used by residents as a swimming hole in spite of recommendations against it by health officials . The area immediately south of the lake had been a swamp which was a haven for mosquitoes . As part of the creation of the park , the original lake was filled in , while the swamp was dredged to form the current Tibbetts Lake . The brook , meanwhile , was diverted into a paved channel . The eastern tributary had been protected by fences and infrastructure from the nearby Old Croton Aqueduct . At the time the park was constructed , the southern portion of the Saw Mill River Parkway was built on top of the dump along the western tributary course . Between the 1930s and 1960s under the supervision of Robert Moses , several highways including the Henry Hudson , Saw Mill and Mosholu Parkways were constructed within Van Cortlandt Park , requiring Tibbetts Brook to be diverted into culverts under the roadways . The creation of the sewer at the south end of Van Cortlandt Lake and the construction of the highways induced siltation of the stream , leading to further creation of marshes . In addition , pollution from upstream and the highways , and spillover of chemicals used in the golf course led to the death of fish inhabiting the lake . In 1978 , the fish population of the lake was restored . In 1979 , four storm sewers along Midland Avenue in Yonkers ( which forms the eastern boundary of Tibbetts Brook Park ) were found to be illegally connected to the brook , pumping raw sewage into it which proceeded to enter Van Cortlandt Lake downstream . That year , another storm drain located at approximately Lawton Street and McLean Avenue near the Saw Mill Parkway , 1,300 feet ( 400 m ) north of the Yonkers / Bronx border , was found to be leaking household sewage into the brook . In 1984 , sewage from Yonkers was again found to be contaminating Van Cortlandt Lake , due to the crossing of raw sewage pipes and storm sewers which feed into Tibbetts Brook . This included water from the Lawton Street drain pipe . The same sewage pipe was found to be the cause of pollution of the lake in 2016 . In the 21st century , it has been proposed to daylight the southern portion of Tibbetts Brook back onto the surface , and to restore and defragment the portions of the stream within Van Cortlandt Park . Proposals to daylight the stream have existed since the 1990s . Around 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 US gallons ( 15 , 000 , 000 to 19,000,000 l ; 3,300,000 to 4,200,000 imp gal ) of fresh water from the brook enter the sewer system on a daily basis , a total of 2,000,000,000 US gallons ( 7 . 6 × 10 9 l ; 1.7 × 10 9 imp gal ) annually . The additional water from the brook also contributes to the further overflowing of raw sewage into the Harlem River during rainy conditions . Meanwhile , the lack of natural drainage points within Van Cortlandt Park leads to the flooding of recreational areas within the park . The New York City Parks Department plans to daylight the brook as part of their "" Van Cortlandt Park Master Plan : 2030 "" . The plan also proposes further dredging the lake and stream within the park , and rerouting the stream away from the highways and pedestrian paths to minimize the use of culverts , as well as restoring the natural wetlands created by the brook . The primary route proposed for bringing the brook above ground is the former Putnam Railroad right-of-way , which is currently owned by CSX Transportation but is largely abandoned between the park and the Harlem River . This portion of the Putnam Railroad is directly adjacent to the southbound lanes of the Major Deegan Expressway . The routing would provide a more natural drainage path for the brook into the Harlem River , with none of the water entering the sewer system on a normal basis . ^ Cook , Lyman ( September 5 , 1820 ) .

"Monday , 25 November , 2002 , 15 : 06 GMT Lords defy Blunkett on life sentences Jail terms ' should be determined by judges ' The home secretary's power to increase the minimum sentence handed down to convicted murderers is "" incompatible "" with human rights laws , the Law Lords have ruled . This is the first step towards taking away the powers home secretaries have to extend the length of time murderers must serve before they can apply for parole in England and Wales . Murderers' cases that could be reviewed : Dennis Nilsen - killed 15 men Rose West - murdered 10 young women , including her eldest daughter Heather , 16 . Arthur Hutchinson - killed a solicitor , his wife and their son and raped their daughter during a burglary Jeremy Bamber - killed his adoptive parents , his step-sister and her six-year-old twin sons In a test case affecting 225 prisoners , a specially convened panel of seven Law Lords accepted the argument by defence lawyers that judges should be handed back the task of fixing minimum tariffs for prisoners serving life for murder . Lord Bingham said the power exercised by the home secretary to decide how long sentences should be , was "" incompatible "" with article six of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right of a convicted person to have a sentence imposed by an independent and impartial tribunal . But Home Secretary David Blunkett has promised new laws to establish a set of principles which judges will use to fix minimum tariffs in the future . Killers' case Home Office Minister Hilary Benn says Parliament must still have a say in the penalties for certain crimes . "" In certain cases , the most heinous crimes , for example , the sexual and sadistic murder of children - life should mean life , "" he told BBC News 24 . "" And we need to make sure that Parliament retains accountability for the framework of sentencing , while recognising that judges will in future hand down sentences for individual cases . "" Raising killers' hopes ? Click here to read The test case was brought by three convicted killers , including double murderer Anthony Anderson , who was jailed in 1988 . Mr Anderson claimed his human rights have been breached by the increase of his minimum prison sentence to 20 years , after his trial judge had recommended 15 . His success could open the way for appeals by 70 prisoners who have already served the minimum tariff set out by the trial judge , but who are now serving additional time set by the home secretary . Many prisoners could sue the government . Whiting : Likely to die in jail It could also open the way for more than 20 murderers with "" whole life "" tariffs to have new minimum terms decided by the Lord Chief Justice , Lord Woolf . Mr Blunkett has insisted that he would not see the most notorious killers , like Harold Shipman , released from prison . He believes "" life means life "" and if this judgement goes against him , he will simply change the law . Brady : Unlikely to ever be released On Saturday , Mr Blunkett announced that Roy Whiting - convicted of murdering eight-year-old Sarah Payne - should serve a 50-year minimum jail term . However the House of Lords ruling is unlikely to affect Whiting since his original trial judge , Mr Justice Richard Curtis , said at the time that it was a rare case in which he would recommend a life sentence meaning life . Staying inside Rose West was jailed in 1995 for a minimum of 25 years for the "" house of horrors "" murders of 10 women , but the home secretary later decided on a whole life tariff . This ruling has no imminent impact on Rose . She has said that she does not want to come out . Leo Goatley Rose West's solicitor Her solicitor , Leo Goatley , told BBC News Online : "" This ruling has no imminent impact on Rose . She has said that she does not want to come out . "" The case comes too late for Moors murder Myra Hindley , who died in prison earlier this month for her part in the killing of five children .

"Alison Steadman Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University Honorable Chancellor, I have pleasure in presenting Alison Steadman for the award of an Honorary Fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University. Alison Steadman is Britain's favourite character actress with an illustrious career embracing theatre, film, TV, and radio. Over a period of four decades, she has created some of the most memorable roles on stage and screen, often deflating vanities with her hilarious and keenly observed performances. Two outstanding roles that immediately spring to mind are the loud and opinionated Mrs Bennet in BBCs Pride & Prejudice and the monstrous Beverley in Abigail's Party. Alison Steadman was born in Liverpool, the daughter of George Steadman and Marjorie Evans. Like many Liverpool families, the Steadmans always enjoyed a good laugh and Alison certainly enjoyed making people laugh. From an early age she displayed a talent for mimicry and decided to become an actress when she was nine. Whilst at Childwall Valley School in South Liverpool, she closely observed comedians like Hylda Baker on television and took every opportunity to practice her talent; whether it was impersonating a Scottish neighbour when putting the dolls to bed or impersonating her teachers at school. After school, she joined the Probation Service as a clerical assistant, attending Liverpool Youth Theatre whenever time allowed. When she was 20, and on the advice of Liverpool Playhouse's Tony Colgate, she auditioned for the East-15 Acting School in Essex, and her impersonation of Cassius Clay won her a place. There, she met a young director named Mike Leigh for the first time. During her final year at East-15, she made her professional stage debut playing Sandie in ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"" at Lincoln's Theatre Royal. Thereafter, she gained further stage experience, including seasons at the Liverpool Everyman and Bolton Octagon Theatre. In 1973, she married Mike Leigh , leading to a creative partnership which produced some of Britain's most important theatre, TV and films -- as well as two sons: Toby and Leo. The most famous collaboration with Mike Leigh was when she played Beverly in Abigail's Party, first in a theatre production in 1977 for which she won the London Evening Standard Theatre Award and the Plays and Players Award for Best Actress, and then in the definitive TV version the same year. So embedded in the British consciousness is this portrayal of the comedy of social aspiration that when she recreated the role at the National Theatre in 1999 in an abridged performance, the audience stood and cheered. Other film work includes A Private Function, Shirley Valentine, Wilt, The Adventures of Baron Munchhausen, and Mike Leigh's critically acclaimed films Topsy Turvy, Secrets and Lies, and Life Is Sweet, for which she won the US National Society of Film Critics Award. Alison has had a regular presence on television since the early 1970s when she featured in Z Cars. Her many credits include the afore-mentioned Pride and Prejudice, Nuts in May, Karaoke, Fat Friends, for which she was BAFTA-nominated, Adrian Mole: The Cappucino Years, Dennis Potter's Singing Detective for which she was BAFTA-nominated, the comedy The Worst Week of My Life, Fanny Hill, and ""News Hounds"" for which she won The Chicago Film Festival Gold Award for Best Actress. From 2007 to 2010 she appeared in the award-winning BBC comedy Gavin & Stacey as Pamela. Over the years Alison has been greatly admired for her memorable stage work, demonstrating her versatility in for example her role as Mari in ""The Rise and Fall of Little Voice"", for which she won a Laurence Olivier Theatre Award for Best Actress in 1992, The Memory of Water for which she was nominated for an Olivier Award, ""The Woman Who Cooked Her Husband"", and Joe Orton's ""Entertaining Mr. Sloane"" . On radio, Alison's talent for mimicry and character voices was evident in shows such as Castle's on the Air, The Worst Show on the Wireless, and Week Ending where her impromptu impression of Margaret Thatcher was particularly noteworthy. Despite her high profile and iconic popularity, Alison is often described as refreshingly down-to-earth, a genuine easy-going person without vanity. As journalist Lesley White puts it, There is nothing of the grandeur or self-conscious graciousness of the theatrical dames about her. She is the star who refuses to shine excessively in case she gets blinded to life's realities. It appears that this unstarriest of stars is never happier than when she's bird-watching, taking the dog for a walk or rambling with the London Wildlife Trust where she can meet ego-free people who are just interested in nature. Alison Steadman's great talent as an entertainer has been recognised through the many accolades and awards she has received over the years, not least when she was invested as Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Millennium Honours List for her services to British Drama. She has also received several honorary degrees, including from the University of Essex, of which her alma mater, the East-15 Acting School is now part. She has incidentally been back to East-15 directing productions in recent years. This much-loved actress who has brought so much pleasure to so many people, is a credit to her native city and we are delighted to honour her achievements today. Thus I have great pleasure in presenting Alison Steadman, this most distinguished daughter of our city, for admission to our highest honour of Fellow of Liverpool John Moores University. ",0,1
"The Age of Adz (pronounced / ɒ d z / ) [ 2 ] is a 2010 album by American singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens , released on October 12, 2010 by Asthmatic Kitty . It is Stevens' sixth studio album and his first song-based full length album in five years, since the release of Illinois in 2005. The album features a heavy use of electronics augmented by orchestration, and takes inspiration from the apocalyptic artwork of schizophrenic artist Royal Robertson . Stevens' use of electronics marked a radical departure from much of his previous work—most notably from Seven Swans and Michigan . Unlike Illinois , the lyrics do not explore events, characters or setting, but deal instead with themes and emotions on a personal level. Critics praised the intimacy of the album, but many were divided over the change in style that Stevens had taken. Nonetheless, it appeared on several ""best of 2010"" lists—including those of Paste , The New York Times and MTV . Commercially, the album gave Stevens his career's best first week sales to date and was his highest charting album to date, peaking in the top ten on the Billboard 200 . Stevens' musical interests have shifted dramatically—he is seen here in 2011 wearing a colorful light-up outfit that fits the obscure electronic themes of The Age of Adz Following his 2005 album Illinois , Stevens did not produce another song-based full length album for five years. [ 2 ] In 2006, he released an album of extra material left over from Illinois (originally conceived as a double album), titled The Avalanche , [ 3 ] as well as an album of Christmas music titled Songs for Christmas (produced in parts between 2001 and 2006). [ 4 ] Following the release of The Avalanche , Stevens expressed a dissatisfaction with his music, stating in an interview with Pitchfork Media in 2006: ""I'm getting tired of my voice. I'm getting tired of...the banjo. I'm getting tired of...the trumpet"". [ 5 ] In 2009 Stevens admitted that his Fifty States Project —an attempt to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. States —had been a ""promotional gimmick"" and not something that he had seriously intended to complete. [ 6 ] In the same year he released The BQE , an orchestral suite accompanying a home-made film dedicated to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway . [ 7 ] In an interview with BeatRoute Magazine in 2010, Stevens stated ""[ The BQE ] kinda sabotaged the mechanical way of approaching my music, which was basically narrative long-form. It really opened things up for me. It also confused things as well. I don’t think I ever really fully recovered from that process"". [ 8 ] On August 20, 2010, without prior announcement, Stevens released the EP All Delighted People , [ 9 ] and less than one week later, announced The Age of Adz to be released on October 12. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In interviews, Stevens stated that during 2009–2010 he suffered from a mysterious debilitating viral infection that affected his nervous system . He experienced chronic pain, and was forced to stop working on music for several months. [ 12 ] He said: "" The Age of Adz , is, in some ways, a result of that process of working through health issues and getting much more in touch with my physical self. That's why I think the record's really obsessed with sensation and has a hysterical melodrama to it."" [ 13 ] The artwork of Royal Robertson , a self-proclaimed prophet from Louisiana, [ 16 ] was used for the album's cover and interior. [ 2 ] Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said that Sufjan Stevens uses the artwork ""as a springboard for music that evokes a visionary psyche."" [ 17 ] Stevens became interested in the work of Robertson after recording music for a friend's documentary on the artist, and said that ""[the more I studied him and his work], the more I felt a weird affinity to this guy and the story of his life."" [ 18 ] He began to transcribe some of the text that appears in Robertson's artwork, and says this process stayed with him a ""long time"" and ""that some of it started to come up in the lyrics, in the songs I was writing. [ 18 ] The Age of Adz marked a radical departure in musical style from that of Stevens' previous album Illinois . Robin Hilton summarised the changes as Stevens ""[replacing] delicately plucked banjo lines, wispy vocals and sentimental melodies with glitchy soundscapes, hip-hop [ sic ] beats and heavily filtered vocals."" [ 19 ] Amongst his other work, the 2001 electronic album Enjoy Your Rabbit was regarded as being the most close in style to this album. [ 16 ] Nevertheless, critics highlighted the first track ""Futile Devices"" as being stylistically consistent with his earlier acoustic work. [ 20 ] Sufjan Stevens himself has said that the album's tracks ""are pop songs, but they’re based on sound experimentation and noise"". [ 21 ] He contrasted the way in which the album was made for listeners who understood his interest in ""electronic music and noise and in sound sculpting and minimalism "", and with Illinois which he described as a "" populist record"". [ 21 ] The Age of Adz departs from the geography-based concepts of Stevens' previous albums; until his announcement in 2009 that he had never seriously intended to complete the project, it had been expected that his next work might continue the Fifty States Project that he had begun with Michigan and continued with Illinois . [ 6 ] The album contains no ""conceptual underpinnings"", [ 16 ] instead focusing on themes that are personal and intimate to Stevens himself; [ 22 ] the label Asthmatic Kitty describes the themes as ""personal and primal … love, sex, death, disease, illness, anxiety, and suicide"". [ 16 ] A recurrent focus of the album is love, [ 23 ] a theme that sometimes overlaps with spirituality as Stevens seems to address both a lover and a divine power. [ 24 ] Another important theme is that of mortality — the song ""Now That I'm Older"" has been noted as ""repeatedly [acknowledging] mortality and the importance of making the most of life."" [ 24 ] Acknowledging the interplay of these two themes, the album has been described as having songs ""in which love and death reign darkly over an imaginative landscape peopled with apparitions, ghosts, orators and space travellers"". [ 23 ] The Age of Adz debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 , with 36,000 copies sold, giving Stevens his career's best first week sales to date. It was his highest charting album to date, peaking in the top ten on the Billboard 200. [ 12 ] [ 25 ] It also placed number one on Billboard's ""Rock Albums"", ""Independent Albums"", ""Alternative Albums"" and ""Folk Albums"" lists, and placed number two on the ""Digital Albums"" and ""Tastemaker Albums"" lists. [ 25 ] The album also placed within the ""Top 100 Albums"" lists in several other countries. [ 26 ] The Age of Adz received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, based on 33 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". [ 27 ] Keith Meatto of the Frontier Psychiatrist described the album as ""a musical masterpiece that blends analog and digital sounds as it reflects on love and loss, life and death, humanity and divinity."" [ 24 ] Entertainment.ie ' s Jenny Mulligan described Stevens as ""a strange one, that's for sure, but he may just be a genius"" [ 30 ] Uncut commented that the album provides plenty of evidence to argue that he is either ""one of the most important songwriters of his generation"" or ""just an infuriating, neurotic show-off"". [ 39 ] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that although the album ""goes a bit barmy and over-the-top."" there are some ""incredible tune[s]"" that are ""not only genuinely remarkable, but genuinely enjoyable"". [ 32 ] Alex Denney of NME similarly commented that the album ""conjures just enough moments of heart-stopping gorgeousness to foot the bill for its dizzying excesses"". [ 34 ] Sam Lewis of the BBC remarked on the same point that the album is ""suffused with individual moments of brilliance"", but felt that overall it was ""let down by its self-conscious incoherence."" [ 28 ] The most discussed track of the album among reviewers was ""Impossible Soul"", which at 25 minutes in length comprises a third of the overall album. Pitchfork 's reviewer Ryan Dombal described the track as having ""more engaging ideas than most artists could muster in a career"", [ 35 ] although No Ripcord reviewer Alan Shulman criticized the middle sections as being an ""epic train wreck"", saying that the closing minutes come as ""a breath of fresh air"". [ 40 ] One Thirty BPM reviewer Rob Hakimian was mixed in his reception of the track, and commented that it would ""make or break"" the album for listeners, describing it as a successful ""proclamation of love"", but also ""bloated"" and ""way over the top"". [ 33 ] Note: On the vinyl release of the album, the last movement (about three minutes) of ""Impossible Soul"" is moved to the end of side C, just after ""I Want to be Well"" for reasons of space and time restrictions.

"Early life and education Stephen Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 [ 1 ] to Frank and Isobel Hawking. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the University of Oxford , where Frank studied medicine and Isobel, Philosophy, Politics and Economics . [ 27 ] The two met shortly after the beginning of the Second World War at a medical research institute where she was working as a secretary and he as a medical researcher . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] They lived in Highgate , but as London was under attack in those years, his mother went to Oxford to give birth in greater safety. [ 29 ] Stephen has two younger sisters, Philippa and Mary, and an adopted brother, Edward. [ 30 ] He began his schooling at the Byron House School; he later blamed its ""progressive methods"" for his failure to learn to read while at the school. [ 31 ] In 1950, when his father became head of the division of parasitology at the National Institute for Medical Research , Hawking and his family moved to St Albans , Hertfordshire. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] The eight-year-old Hawking attended St Albans High School for Girls for a few months; at that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] In St Albans, the family were considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric; [ 31 ] [ 35 ] meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book. [ 31 ] They lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house, and travelled in a converted London taxicab. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] During one of Hawking's father's frequent absences working in Africa, [ 38 ] the rest of the family spent four months in Majorca visiting his mother's friend Beryl and her husband, the poet Robert Graves . [ 33 ] On their return to England, Hawking attended Radlett School for a year [ 34 ] and from September 1952, St Albans School . [ 39 ] The family placed a high value on education. [ 31 ] Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School , but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, [ 42 ] and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception . [ 43 ] From 1958, and with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta , they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Although at school he was known as ""Einstein,"" Hawking was not initially successful academically. [ 46 ] With time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects, and inspired by Tahta, decided to study mathematics at university. [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates. [ 50 ] He wanted Hawking to attend University College, Oxford , his own alma mater . As it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, Hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] University Hawking began his university education at the University of Oxford in October 1959 at the age of 17. [ 53 ] For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonely: he was younger than many other students, and found the academic work ""ridiculously easy."" [ 54 ] [ 55 ] His physics tutor Robert Berman later said, ""It was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it."" [ 56 ] A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more effort ""to be one of the boys"". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction. [ 53 ] Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing team. [ 57 ] [ 58 ] The rowing trainer at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats. [ 59 ] [ 57 ] Hawking has estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his Finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva necessary. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student, so when asked at the oral examination to describe his future plans, he said, ""If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First."" [ 61 ] [ 63 ] He was held in higher regard than he believed: as Berman commented, the examiners ""were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves."" [ 61 ] After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree , and following a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge , in October 1962. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] Hawking's first year as a doctoral student [ 12 ] was difficult. He was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned Dennis William Sciama as a supervisor rather than Fred Hoyle , [ 66 ] [ 67 ] and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology . [ 68 ] He also struggled with his health. Hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at Oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] The problems worsened, and his speech became slightly slurred ; his family noticed the changes when he returned home for Christmas and medical investigations were begun. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] The diagnosis of motor neurone disease came when Hawking was 21. At the time, doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] After his diagnosis, Hawking fell into a depression; though his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point. [ 75 ] At the same time, however, his relationship with Jane Wilde, friend of his sister, and whom he had met shortly before his diagnosis, continued to develop. The couple were engaged in October 1964. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Hawking later said that the engagement ""gave him something to live for."" [ 78 ] Despite the disease's progression—Hawking had difficulty walking without support, and his speech was almost unintelligible—he now returned to his work with enthusiasm. [ 79 ] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] When Hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the Big Bang and the Steady State theories. [ 82 ] Inspired by Roger Penrose 's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, Hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe, and during 1965 wrote up his thesis on this topic. [ 83 ] There were other positive developments: Hawking received a research fellowship at Gonville and Caius College , and he and Jane were married on 14 July 1965. [ 84 ] He obtained his D.Phil. degree in March 1966, [ 85 ] and his essay entitled ""Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time"" shared top honours with one by Penrose to win that year's Adams Prize . [ 86 ] [ 85 ] Later life and career 1966–1975 The first years of marriage were hectic: Jane lived in London during the week as she completed her degree and they travelled to the United States several times for conferences and physics-related visits. The couple had difficulty finding housing that was within Hawking's walking distance to the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). Jane began a Ph.D. program, and a son, Robert, was born in May 1967. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] In 1970 they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann , then it must have begun as a singularity . [ 91 ] [ 92 ] [ 93 ] During the late 1960s, Hawking's physical abilities declined once more: he began to use crutches and ceased lecturing regularly. [ 94 ] As he slowly lost the ability to write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry. [ 95 ] [ 96 ] The physicist Werner Israel later compared the achievements to Mozart composing an entire symphony in his head. [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Hawking was, however, fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for his disabilities. He preferred to be regarded as ""a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person."" [ 99 ] Jane Hawking later noted that ""Some people would call it determination, some obstinacy. I've called it both at one time or another."" [ 100 ] He required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the 1960s, [ 101 ] but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving. [ 100 ] Hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness as well as his reputation for brashness and intelligence distanced him from some. [ 102 ] In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created 'Fellowship for Distinction in Science' to remain at Caius. [ 103 ] Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics . [ 113 ] [ 112 ] His work in this area was spurred by a visit to Moscow and discussions with Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich and Alexei Starobinsky, whose work showed that according to the uncertainty principle rotating black holes emit particles. [ 114 ] To Hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller, [ 115 ] and supported Bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy . [ 116 ] [ 114 ] His results, which Hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation , known today as Hawking radiation , which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate . [ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 119 ] Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. However by the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. [ 120 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ] In March 1974, a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation, Hawking was invested as a Fellow of the Royal Society , one of the youngest scientists to be so honoured. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] Hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, even—in a precedent set during their courtship—with Jane. [ 125 ] Hawking's disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics. [ 126 ] When in 1974 Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Scholar visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. Hawking accepted, and Bernard Carr travelled to California with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role. [ 127 ] [ 128 ] The family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in Pasadena . [ 129 ] Hawking worked with his friend on the faculty, Kip Thorne , [ 130 ] and engaged him in a scientific wager about whether the dark star Cygnus X-1 was a black hole. The wager was a surprising ""insurance policy"" against the proposition that black holes did not exist. [ 131 ] Hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, which was the first of several that he was to make with Thorne and others. [ 132 ] Hawking has maintained ties to Caltech, spending a month there almost every year since this first visit. [ 133 ] 1975–1990 Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home, a new job—as Reader . Don Page , with whom Hawking had begun a close friendship at Caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant. With Page's help and that of a secretary, Jane's responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her thesis and her new interest in singing. [ 134 ] The mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and of the physicist who was studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] He also received increasing academic recognition of his work. [ 137 ] In 1975 he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal , and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize , the Maxwell Prize and the Hughes Medal . [ 138 ] [ 139 ] Hawking was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977. [ 140 ] The following year he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford. [ 77 ] [ 137 ] Hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could only be understood by his family and closest friends. To communicate with others, someone who knew him well would translate his speech into intelligible speech. [ 141 ] Spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, Hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in Cambridge, [ 142 ] [ 143 ] including adapted student housing at the university. [ 144 ] In general, however, Hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a disability rights champion: while wanting to help others, he sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges. [ 145 ] His lack of engagement led to some criticism. [ 146 ] The Hawking family welcomed a third child, Timothy, in April 1979. [ 137 ] That autumn Hawking was appointed the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. [ 137 ] [ 147 ] Hawking's inaugural lecture as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics was titled: ""Is the end in sight for Theoretical Physics"" and proposed N=8 Supergravity as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying. [ 148 ] Hawking's promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to Hawking accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home. [ 149 ] At the same time he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. ""I would rather be right than rigorous"" he told Kip Thorne. [ 150 ] In 1981 he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. This information paradox violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and was to lead to years of debate, including "" the Black Hole War "" with Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft . [ 151 ] [ 152 ] In December 1977, Jane had met organist Jonathan Hellyer Jones when singing in a church choir. Hellyer Jones became close to the Hawking family, and by the mid-1980s, he and Jane had developed romantic feelings for each other. [ 140 ] [ 153 ] [ 154 ] According to Jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating ""he would not object so long as I continued to love him."" [ 140 ] [ 155 ] [ 156 ] Jane and Hellyer Jones determined not to break up the family and their relationship remained platonic for a long period. [ 157 ] Cosmological inflation —a theory proposing that following the Big Bang the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansion—was proposed by Alan Guth and also developed by Andrei Linde . [ 158 ] Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and Gary Gibbons organized a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on the Very Early Universe at Cambridge University, which focused mainly on inflation theory. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] [ 161 ] Hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe. In 1981 at a Vatican conference he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary—or beginning or ending—to the universe. [ 162 ] [ 163 ] He subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim Hartle , and in 1983 they published a model, known as the Hartle–Hawking state . It proposed that prior to the Planck epoch , the universe had no boundary in space-time; before the Big Bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless. [ 164 ] The initial singularity of the classical Big Bang models was replaced with a region akin to the North Pole. One cannot travel north of the North Pole, but there is no boundary there—it is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end. [ 165 ] [ 166 ] Initially the no-boundary proposal predicted a closed universe which had implications about the existence of God. As Hawking explained ""If the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then God would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began."" [ 167 ] Hawking did not rule out the existence of a Creator, asking in A Brief History of Time ""Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?"" [ 168 ] In his early work, Hawking spoke of God in a metaphorical sense. In A Brief History of Time he wrote: ""If we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we should know the mind of God."" [ 169 ] In the same book he suggested the existence of God was unnecessary to explain the origin of the universe. Later discussions with Neil Turok led to the realisation that it is also compatible with an open universe. [ 170 ] Further work by Hawking in the area of arrows of time led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards. [ 171 ] A paper by Don Page and Raymond Laflamme led Hawking to withdraw this concept. [ 172 ] Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American Franklin Medal , [ 173 ] and in 1982 made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). [ 174 ] [ 175 ] Awards do not pay the bills, however, and motivated by the need to finance the children's education and home expenses, in 1982 Hawking determined to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public. [ 176 ] [ 177 ] Instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with Bantam Books , a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] A first draft of the book, called A Brief History of Time , was completed in 1984. [ 180 ] During a visit to CERN in Geneva in the summer of 1985, Hawking contracted pneumonia which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that Jane was asked if life support should be terminated. She refused but the consequence was a tracheotomy , which would require round-the-clock nursing care, and remove what remained of his speech. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] The National Health Service would pay for a nursing home but Jane was determined that he would live at home. The cost of the care was funded by an American foundation. [ 183 ] [ 184 ] Nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. One of those employed was Elaine Mason, who was to become Hawking's second wife. [ 185 ] For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card . [ 186 ] But he then received a computer program called the ""Equalizer"" from Walt Woltosz. In a method he uses to this day, using a switch he selects phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2500–3000 that are scanned . [ 187 ] [ 188 ] The program was originally run on a desktop computer. However, Elaine Mason's husband David, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair. [ 189 ] Released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, Hawking commented that ""I can communicate better now than before I lost my voice."" [ 190 ] The voice he uses has an American accent and is no longer produced. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] Despite the availability of other voices, Hawking has retained his original voice, saying that he prefers his current voice and identifies with it. [ 193 ] At this point, Hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to 15 words a minute. [ 194 ] Lectures were prepared in advance, and sent to the speech synthesiser in short sections as they were delivered. [ 191 ] One of the first messages Hawking produced with his speech generating device was a request for his assistant to help him finish writing A Brief History of Time . [ 194 ] Peter Guzzardi, his editor at Bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non-technical language, a process that required multiple revisions from an increasingly irritated Hawking. [ 195 ] The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of bestseller lists in both countries and remaining there for weeks and months. [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] The book was translated into multiple languages, [ 199 ] and ultimately sold an estimated 9 million copies. [ 198 ] Media attention was intense, [ 199 ] and Newsweek magazine cover and a television special both described him as ""Master of the Universe"". Success led to significant financial rewards, but also the challenges of celebrity status. [ 200 ] Hawking travelled extensively to promote his work, and enjoyed partying and dancing [ citation needed ] into the small hours. [ 199 ] He had difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors which left limited time for work and his students. [ 201 ] Some colleagues were resentful of the attention Hawking received, feeling it was due to his disability. [ 202 ] [ 203 ] He received further academic recognition, including five further honorary degrees, [ 204 ] the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1985), [ 205 ] the Paul Dirac Medal (1987) [ 204 ] and, jointly with Penrose, the prestigious Wolf Prize (1988). [ 206 ] In 1989, he was named a Companion of Honour by Queen Elizabeth II . [ 201 ] 1990–2000 Hawking's marriage had been strained for many years. Jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants. The impact of his celebrity was challenging for colleagues and family members, and in one interview Jane described her role as ""simply to tell him that he's not God."" [ 207 ] [ 208 ] Hawking's agnostic views of religion also contrasted with her strong Christian faith, and resulted in tension. [ 209 ] [ 208 ] [ 210 ] In the late 1980s Hawking had grown close to one of his nurses, Elaine Mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers and family members who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness. [ 211 ] Hawking told Jane that he was leaving her for Mason, [ 212 ] and departed the family home in February 1990. [ 174 ] Following his divorce from Jane in the spring of 1995, Hawking married Mason in September, [ 213 ] [ 174 ] declaring ""It's wonderful—I have married the woman I love."" [ 214 ] Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons, and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang. [ 215 ] In 1994 at Cambridge's Newton Institute , Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures, which were published in 1996 as ""The Nature of Space and Time"". [ 216 ] In 1997 he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a ""cosmic censorship conjecture""—that there could be no ""naked singularities"" unclothed within a horizon—was correct. [ 217 ] After discovering his concession might have been premature, a new, more refined, wager was made. This specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions. [ 218 ] The same year, Thorne, Hawking and Preskill made another bet, this time concerning the black hole information paradox . [ 219 ] [ 220 ] Thorne and Hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by Hawking Radiation must be ""new"", and not from inside the black hole event horizon . Since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. Preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way. [ 221 ] Hawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. In 1992 a film version of ""A Brief History of Time""—directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg —was premiered. Hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical, but was persuaded otherwise. The film, while a critical success, was however not widely released. [ 222 ] A popular-level collection of essays, interviews and talk titled Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays was published in 1993 [ 223 ] and six-part television series Stephen Hawking's Universe and companion book appeared in 1997. As Hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science. [ 224 ] [ 225 ] He also made several appearances in popular media. At the release party for the home video version of the ""A Brief History of Time"", Leonard Nimoy , who had played Spock on Star Trek , learnt that Hawking was interested in appearing on the show. Nimoy made the necessary contact and Hawking appeared as himself on Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993. [ 226 ] [ 227 ] [ 228 ] The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song "" Keep Talking "", [ 229 ] [ 223 ] and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons . [ 230 ] In the 1990s, Hawking accepted more openly the mantle of role model for disabled people, including lecturing on the subject and participating in fundraising activities. [ 231 ] At the turn of the century, he and eleven other luminaries signed the ""Charter for the Third Millennium on Disability"" which called on governments to prevent disability and protect disabled rights. [ 232 ] [ 233 ] In 1999 Hawking was awarded the Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize of the American Physical Society . [ 234 ] The same year, Jane Hawking published a memoir, Music to Move the Stars , describing her marriage to Hawking and its breakdown. Its revelations caused a sensation in the media, but as was his usual practice regarding his personal life, Hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself. [ 235 ] Following his second marriage, Hawking's family felt excluded and marginalised from his life. [ 210 ] [ 236 ] For a period of about five years in the early 2000s, his family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being physically abused. [ 236 ] [ 237 ] Police investigations took place, but were closed as Hawking refused to make a complaint. [ 236 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ] Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The Universe in a Nutshell in 2001, [ 240 ] and A Briefer History of Time which he wrote in 2005 with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works to make them accessible to a wider audience, and God Created the Integers , which appeared in 2006. [ 241 ] Along with Thomas Hertog at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of ""top-down cosmology"", which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state. [ 242 ] Top-down cosmology posits that the present ""selects"" the past from a superposition of many possible histories. In doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the fine-tuning question . [ 243 ] [ 244 ] In 2006 Hawking and Elaine quietly divorced, [ 245 ] [ 246 ] following which Hawking resumed closer relationships with Jane, his children and grandchildren. [ 246 ] [ 208 ] Reflecting this happier period a revised version of Jane's book called Travelling to Infinity, My Life with Stephen appeared in 2007. [ 236 ] That year Hawking and his daughter Lucy published George's Secret Key to the Universe , a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the Hawking family. [ 247 ] The book was followed by sequels in 2009 and 2011. [ 248 ] Hawking continued to feature regularly on the screen: documentaries entitled :The Real Stephen Hawking: (2001) [ 249 ] and ""Stephen Hawking: Profile"" (2002), [ 250 ] a TV film Hawking about the period around the onset of Hawking's illness (2004), [ 250 ] and a documentary series Stephen Hawking, Master of the Universe (2008). [ 251 ] Hawking made further appearances in animated form on The Simpsons , [ 252 ] [ 253 ] and Futurama [ 244 ] in which he does his own voice acting, [ 254 ] and in person on The Big Bang Theory . [ 255 ] Hawking continued to travel widely, including trips to Chile , Easter Island , South Africa and Spain (to receive the Fonseca Prize in 2008) [ 256 ] [ 257 ] Canada [ 258 ] and multiple trips to the United States. [ 259 ] For practical reasons related to his disability Hawking increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of international travel. [ 260 ] Over the years, Hawking maintained his public profile with a series of attention-getting and often controversial statements: [ 261 ] he has asserted that computer viruses were a form of life, [ 262 ] that humans should use genetic engineering to avoid being outsmarted by computers, [ 263 ] and that aliens likely exist and contact with them should be avoided. [ 264 ] [ 265 ] Hawking has expressed his concerns that life on earth is at risk due to ""a sudden nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other dangers we have not yet thought of"". [ 266 ] He views spaceflight and the colonisation of space as necessary for the future of humanity. [ 266 ] [ 267 ] Motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities, in 2007 he participated in zero-gravity flight in a "" Vomit Comet "", courtesy of Zero Gravity Corporation , during which he experienced weightlessness eight times. [ 266 ] [ 268 ] [ 269 ] [ 270 ] In the area of physics, by 2003, consensus was growing that Hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole. [ 284 ] In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, the physicist conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution, to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology . [ 285 ] [ 221 ] In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without. [ 220 ] [ 286 ] In January 2014 he called this his ""biggest blunder."" [ 287 ] As part of another longstanding scientific dispute, Hawking had emphatically argued, and bet, that the Higgs Boson would never be found. [ 288 ] The particle, proposed to exist as part of the Higgs Field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964, became discoverable with the advent of the Fermilab near Chicago and the Large Electron Positron and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN . [ 289 ] Hawking and Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising Hawking's work and complaining that Hawking's ""celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have."" [ 289 ] The particle was discovered at CERN in July 2012: Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet [ 290 ] [ 291 ] and said that Higgs should win the Nobel Prize for Physics . [ 292 ] In 2007 he posed this open question on the Internet: “In a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?” A month later he confessed: “I don’t know the answer. That is why I asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face.” The Guardian , Britain. Hawking's disease-related deterioration has continued, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles, [ 293 ] [ 294 ] [ 295 ] with a rate of about one word per minute. [ 294 ] With this decline there is a risk of him acquiring locked-in syndrome , so Hawking is collaborating with researchers on systems that could translate Hawking's brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations. [ 244 ] [ 295 ] [ 296 ] By 2009 he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently. [ 297 ] He has increased breathing difficulties, requiring a ventilator at times, and has been hospitalized several times. [ 244 ] In 2002, following a UK-wide vote, the BBC included him in their list of the 100 Greatest Britons . Hawking was awarded the Copley Medal from the Royal Society (2006), [ 298 ] America's highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2009), [ 299 ] [ 300 ] and the Russian Fundamental Physics Prize (2012). [ 301 ] Several buildings have been named after him, including the Stephen W. Hawking Science Museum in San Salvador , El Salvador, [ 302 ] the Stephen Hawking Building in Cambridge, [ 303 ] and the Stephen Hawking Centre at Perimeter Institute in Canada. [ 304 ] Appropriately, given Hawking's association with time, he unveiled the mechanical ""Chronophage"" (or time-eating) Corpus Clock at Corpus Christi College Cambridge in September 2008. [ 305 ] [ 306 ] As required by university regulations, Hawking retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 2009. Despite suggestions that he might leave the United Kingdom as a protest against public funding cuts to basic scientific research, [ 307 ] Hawking has continued to work as director of research at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, and has indicated no plans to retire. [ 308 ] Hawking has stated that he is ""not religious in the normal sense"" and he believes that ""the universe is governed by the laws of science. The laws may have been decreed by God, but God does not intervene to break the laws."" [ 309 ] In an interview published in The Guardian , Hawking regarded the concept of Heaven as a myth , believing that there is ""no heaven or afterlife"" and that such a notion was a ""fairy story for people afraid of the dark."" [ 169 ] In 2011, when narrating the first episode of the American television series Curiosity on the Discovery Channel , Hawking declared: We are each free to believe what we want and it is my view that the simplest explanation is there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization. There is probably no heaven, and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that, I am extremely grateful. [ 310 ] [ 311 ] At Google's Zeitgeist Conference in 2011, Hawking said that ""philosophy is dead."" He believes that philosophers ""have not kept up with modern developments in science"" and that scientists ""have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge."" He said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which ""lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it"". [ 312 ] In August 2012 Hawking narrated the ""Enlightenment"" segment of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony . [ 313 ] In 2013, the biographical documentary film Hawking , in which Hawking himself is featured, was released. [ 314 ] [ 315 ] [ 316 ] In September 2013, he expressed support for the legalization of assisted suicide for the terminally ill. [ 317 ] We are all different – but we share the same human spirit. Perhaps it's human nature that we adapt – and survive. Awards and honours Hawking has received numerous awards and honours. In 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS). His nomination reads “ Hawking has made major contributions to the field of general relativity. These derive from a deep understanding of what is relevant to physics and astronomy, and especially from a mastery of wholly new mathematical techniques. Following the pioneering work of Penrose he established, partly alone and partly in collaboration with Penrose, a series of successively stronger theorems establishing the fundamental result that all realistic cosmological models must possess singularities. Using similar techniques, Hawking has proved the basic theorems on the laws governing black holes: that stationary solutions of Einstein's equations with smooth event horizons must necessarily be axisymmetric; and that in the evolution and interaction of black holes, the total surface area of the event horizons must increase. In collaboration with G. Ellis, Hawking is the author of an impressive and original treatise on ""Space-time in the Large"". Other important work by Hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors. [ 13 ] ",1,1
"Advocating for children's play -- away from TV screens An open letter to the manager of David Lloyd Leisure. Dear Manager, When the excellent new children's area opened at my local David Lloyd club over a year ago, I wrote to you remarking that I felt the area was very much spoilt by the presence of television screens, and requesting that their inclusion be reconsidered. I pointed out that there were no other soft play facilities in the city, that I am aware of, that have TV screens, and that I felt their presence was disruptive to the children's play. Your response reported that the TVs had received 'mixed reviews' from parents, but that some liked having them there. Over the last 18 months I have used this facility regularly. My child very much enjoys the time he spends there -- it has become familiar to him, as have the staff, and other children who go there regularly, making him feel comfortable and relaxed there and able to enjoy all it has to offer. As well as taking part in some of the organised activities, he very  much likes spending time in the play area with other children. He is an only child, and this social aspect of the club is of great benefit to him. However, I have repeatedly observed during our visits there, the negative effect of the TV screens on this social aspect of the children's play. One of the screens is visible from all angles of the main play area, including from the soft play structure. On every visit, I have observed how these screens distract from and interfere with the children's play. Their attention is repeatedly drawn towards the screen. Some children are unable to draw themselves away from it, and end up leaving off their play with the other children to sit in the play structure staring at the screen, despite being often unable to hear the sound. Those children who are able to re-focus their attention away from the screen do so only to have it drawn back at frequent and regular intervals. This is disruptive to the flow of their play and their thoughts. If you observe the children's play closely enough you will see that they are doing more than simply enjoying the physical aspects of the climbing structure and slide. They are often engaged in some sort of imaginative, creative, make believe play. They devise their own rules and roles, negotiate and interact with each other, create fantasies. This type of play is extremely beneficial to children, yet sadly something for which there are fewer opportunities today, with the introduction of homework at younger ages, more scheduled activities, fear of allowing children to play out , and of course, screen technology .  I therefore feel opportunities for this type of play are valuable and should be facilitated as much as possible. However, it's certainly not facilitated by the constant distraction of TV screens. I have also observed other parents at the facility. Contrary to your assertions, I have not seen any that appear to welcome the presence of the TV. In fact I often see parents struggling to get their children to finish their meals because they are distracted by the TV. On a number of occasions I have asked parents if they object to my turning the TV off. They have always been more than happy for me to do so. However, I find that the staff appear to have been instructed to ensure the TV is on at all times. When I have pointed out that I, and others, do not want it on, they have simply put it on with the sound down -- as I have illustrated above, this is not conducive to the social interaction and creative, imaginative play that the children are trying to engage in. I also wonder if your staff are aware that the CBBC channel is actually intended for children aged 6 to 12. Yet the majority of children using the facility are younger than this, and many of the programmes on this channel unsuitable for them. As I mentioned in my original correspondence with you, children are unable to self-regulate. If a TV screen is there they will watch it, whether or not they find the content disturbing, and whether or not there are better things to do. There have been many studies that show the negative effects of background TV on children's play and attention spans. Childhood today is already encroached upon enough by the existence of screen technology.  Please ask yourself again if the TV screens in the children's area at your club are really necessary, or indeed wanted by the parents, or beneficial to the children. Yours sincerely A long-time club member, concerned parent, and advocate of children's play. *After receiving this letter, the manager of the club telephoned me to say that they would be turning the TV off in the children's play area on a trial basis.

"Tender is the Night, by F. Scott Fitzgerald XIV When they reached Paris Nicole was too tired to go on to the grand illumination at the Decorative Art Exposition as they had planned. They left her at the Hotel Roi George, and as she disappeared between the intersecting planes made by lobby lights of the glass doors, Rosemary's oppression lifted. Nicole was a force -- not necessarily well disposed or predictable like her mother -- an incalculable force. Rosemary was somewhat afraid of her. At eleven she sat with Dick and the Norths at a houseboat caf just opened on the Seine. The river shimmered with lights from the bridges and cradled many cold moons. On Sundays sometimes when Rosemary and her mother had lived in Paris they had taken the little steamer up to Suresnes and talked about plans for the future. They had little money but Mrs. Speers was so sure of Rosemary's beauty and had implanted in her so much ambition, that she was willing to gamble the money on ""advantages""; Rosemary in turn was to repay her mother when she got her start . . . . Since reaching Paris Abe North had had a thin vinous fur over him; his eyes were bloodshot from sun and wine. Rosemary realized for the first time that he was always stopping in places to get a drink, and she wondered how Mary North liked it. Mary was quiet, so quiet save for her frequent laughter that Rosemary had learned little about her. She liked the straight dark hair brushed back until it met some sort of natural cascade that took care of it -- from time to time it eased with a jaunty slant over the corner of her temple, until it was almost in her eye when she tossed her head and caused it to fall sleek into place once more. ""We'll turn in early to-night, Abe, after this drink."" Mary's voice was light but it held a little flicker of anxiety. ""You don't want to be poured on the boat."" ""It's pretty late now,"" Dick said. ""We'd all better go."" The noble dignity of Abe's face took on a certain stubbornness, and he remarked with determination: ""Oh, no."" He paused gravely. ""Oh, no, not yet. We'll have another bottle of champagne."" ""No more for me,"" said Dick. ""It's Rosemary I'm thinking of. She's a natural alcoholic -- keeps a bottle of gin in the bathroom and all that -- her mother told me."" He emptied what was left of the first bottle into Rosemary's glass. She had made herself quite sick the first day in Paris with quarts of lemonade; after that she had taken nothing with them but now she raised the champagne and drank at it. ""But what's this?"" exclaimed Dick. ""You told me you didn't drink."" ""I didn't say I was never going to."" ""What about your mother?"" ""I'm just going to drink this one glass."" She felt some necessity for it. Dick drank, not too much, but he drank, and perhaps it would bring her closer to him, be a part of the equipment for what she had to do. She drank it quickly, choked and then said, ""Besides, yesterday was my birthday -- I was eighteen."" ""Why didn't you tell us?"" they said indignantly. ""I knew you'd make a fuss over it and go to a lot of trouble."" She finished the champagne. ""So this is the celebration."" ""Abe feels that nothing matters till he gets on the boat,"" said Mary. ""This time he really has got everything planned out when he gets to New York."" She spoke as though she were tired of saying things that no longer had a meaning for her, as if in reality the course that she and her husband followed, or failed to follow, had become merely an intention. ""He'll be writing music in America and I'll be working at singing in Munich, so when we get together again there'll be nothing we can't do."" ""That's wonderful,"" agreed Rosemary, feeling the champagne. ""Meanwhile, another touch of champagne for Rosemary. Then she'll be more able to rationalize the acts of her lymphatic glands. They only begin to function at eighteen."" Dick laughed indulgently at Abe, whom he loved, and in whom he had long lost hope: ""That's medically incorrect and we're going."" Catching the faint patronage Abe said lightly: ""Something tells me I'll have a new score on Broadway long before you've finished your scientific treatise."" ""I hope so,"" said Dick evenly. ""I hope so. I may even abandon what you call my 'scientific treatise.'"" ""Oh, Dick!"" Mary's voice was startled, was shocked. Rosemary had never before seen Dick's face utterly expressionless; she felt that this announcement was something momentous and she was inclined to exclaim with Mary ""Oh, Dick!"" But suddenly Dick laughed again, added to his remark "" -- abandon it for another one,"" and got up from the table. ""But Dick, sit down. I want to know -- "" ""I'll tell you some time. Good night, Abe. Good night, Mary."" ""Good night, dear Dick."" Mary smiled as if she were going to be perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted boat. She was a brave, hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere, changing herself to this kind of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay. And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort of token . . . . ",8,8

The reprint incorporates all the amendments to the regulations as at 1 December 2011, as specified in the list of amendments at the end of these notes. Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal enactment, in chronological order. For more information, see http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprin\\... . 2 Status of reprints Under section 16D of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption applies even though editorial changes authorised by section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have been made in the reprint. This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the principal enactment and its amendments are contained. 3 How reprints are prepared A number of editorial conventions are followed in the preparation of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked are omitted. For a detailed list of the editorial conventions, see http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/editor\\... or Part 8 of the Tables of New Zealand Acts and Ordinances and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force . 4 Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 Section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set out in sections 17D and 17E of that Act so that, to the extent permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted. A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000. Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since 1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legislation reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of the reprint. In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the authority of section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:  omission of unnecessary referential words (such as "" of this section "" and "" of this Act "" )  typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5 point)  layout of provisions, including:  indentation  position of section headings (eg, the number and heading now appear above the section)  format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears in bold type, without quotation marks)  format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as "" the 1st day of January 1999 "" is now expressed as "" 1 January 1999 "" )  position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front page of each Act)  punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)  Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed accordingly  case and appearance of letters and words, including:  format of headings (eg, headings where each word formerly appeared with an initial capital letter followed by small capital letters are amended so that the heading appears in bold, with only the first word (and any proper nouns) appearing with an initial capital letter)  small capital letters in section and subsection references are now capital letters  schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accordingly  running heads (the information that appears at the top of each page)  format of two-column schedules of consequential amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chronological).

"A Dash from Diamond City George Manville Fenn | Next chapter | | Previous chapter | | Contents | Chapter XXXVIII . The Surgeon's Words . "" Bad enough , poor fellow ; but I think I can pull them both round . Nothing vital , you see , touched , and these Mauser bullets make wonderfully clean wounds ! "" "" And the other ? "" "" Bad flesh-wounds--great loss of blood . I just got at that artery in time . "" West heard these words spoken by someone whose head kept getting in his way as he lay staring up at the great bright stars directly overhead , and it seemed very tiresome . He tried to speak and ask whoever it was to move aside ; but his tongue would not stir , and he lay perfectly still , trying to think what it all meant , and in a dull far-off sort of way it gradually dawned upon him that the people near him were talking about the Boers he had somehow or another and for some reason shot down . Then , as he thought , the calm feeling he was enjoying grew troubled , and he began to recall the fact that he had been shooting somebody's ponies to supply somebody else with food , and that he must have been mad , for he felt convinced that they would not be nice eating , as he had heard that the fat was oily and the flesh tasted sweet . Besides which , it would be horrible to have to eat horseflesh at a time when his throat was dry with an agonising thirst . Then the terrible thought forced itself upon him that while shooting down ponies he had missed them and killed men instead , and once more all was blank . The next time the power of thinking came to the poor fellow all was very dark , and a jarring pain kept running through him , caused by the motion of his hard bed , which had somehow grown wheels and was being dragged along . Cattle were lowing and sheep bleating . There were shouts , too , such as he knew were uttered by Kaffir drivers , and there were the crackings of their great whips . After a while he made out the trampling of horses and heard men talking , while in an eager confused way he listened for what they would say about those two wounded Boers , one of whom had nearly bled to death before that artery was stopped . These , he felt , must be the Boers he shot when he ought to have shot ponies . And as he got to that point the trouble of thinking worried his brain so that he could think no more , and again all was blank . At last came a morning when West woke up in a great room which seemed to be familiar . There were nurses moving about in their clean white-bordered dresses , and he knew that he was in some place fitted up as a hospital . Several of the occupants of the beds wore bandages suggestive of bad wounds , and to help his thoughts there came from time to time the dull heavy reports of cannon . He did not recollect all that had preceded his coming yet ; but he grasped the fact that he had been wounded and was now in hospital . He lay for a few minutes with his brain growing clearer and clearer , and at last , seeing one of the nurses looking in his direction , he tried to raise one hand , but could not . The other proved more manageable , and in obedience to a sign the nurse came , laid a hand upon his forehead , and smiled down in his face . "" Your head's cooler ! "" she said . "" You 're better ? "" "" Yes , "" he replied : "" have I been very bad ? "" "" Terribly ! We thought once that you would not recover . "" "" And Ingleborough ? "" "" Ingleborough ? Oh , you mean your companion who was brought in with you ? "" West nodded : he could not speak . "" Well , I think he will get better now ! "" "" But his wound : is it so bad ? "" "" He nearly bled to death ; but you must not talk much yet . "" "" Only a little ! "" said West eagerly . "" Pray tell me , he will get better ? "" "" Oh yes : there 's no doubt about it , I believe . "" "" Oh , thank goodness ! "" cried West fervently . "" But what place is this ? "" "" This ? Why , Kimberley , of course ! "" "" Ah ! "" cried West excitedly , and his hand went to his breast . "" My jacket ! "" "" Your jacket ? "" said the nurse . "" Oh , that was all cut and torn , and soaked with blood . I think it has been burnt . "" "" What ! "" cried West . "" Oh , do n't say that ! "" "" Hush , hush ! What is this ? "" said a deep , stern voice . "" Patient delirious , nurse ? "" A quiet , grave-looking face was bent over West's pillow , and the poor fellow jumped at the idea that this must be the surgeon . "" No , sir ; no , sir ! "" he whispered excitedly , catching at the new-comer's arm . "" I am better : it is only that I am in trouble about my clothes . "" "" Clothes , eh ? "" said the doctor , smiling . "" Oh , you will not want clothes for two or three weeks yet . "" "" Not to dress , sir , "" whispered West excitedly ; "" but I must have my jacket . It is important ! "" "" Why ? "" said the surgeon , laying his hand upon the young man's brow soothingly . "" I was bringing on a despatch from Mafeking when I was shot down , sir , "" whispered West excitedly . "" It was sewn up for safety in the breast . "" "" Indeed ? "" said the doctor , laying his fingers on the lad's pulse and looking keenly in his eyes . "" Yes , sir , indeed ! "" said West eagerly . "" I know what I am saying , sir . "" "" Yes , you are cool now ; but I 'm afraid the jacket will have been burned with other garments of the kind . Of course , the contents of the pockets will have been preserved . "" "" Oh , they are nothing , sir , "" cried West piteously . "" It is a letter sewn up in the breast that I want . It is so important ! "" "" Well , I 'll see ! "" said the doctor gravely , and , signing to the nurse who had been in attendance , he left the ward , with West in a state of feverish anxiety . At last , to West's intense satisfaction , the horribly blood-stained garment was brought in , and his hand went out trembling to catch it by the breast , fully expecting to find the missive gone . "" Yes , "" he cried wildly , "" it is here ! "" "" Hah ! "" cried the doctor , and , taking out his knife , he prepared to slit it up , but West checked him . "" No , "" he panted : "" the Commandant . Send for him here ! "" "" My good lad , he is so busy , he would not come ! Let me cut out the message and send it to him . "" "" No , "" said West firmly ; "" I will not part from it till he comes . "" "" But really -- "" "" Tell him a wounded messenger from Mafeking has a letter for him , and he will come . "" West was right : the magic word Mafeking brought the Commandant to his bedside ; and as soon as he came up he stopped short and made what little blood poor West had left flush to his face , for he cried : "" Hullo ! Why , it is our illicit-diamond-dealer ! I thought we were never to see you again ! "" "" It is not true ! "" cried West . "" The man who denounced me lied ! "" "" Then you have been to Mafeking ? "" "" Yes , sir : Mr. Ingleborough and I. "" "" And brought back a despatch ? "" "" Yes , sir : here it is ! "" "" Where ? "" said the Commandant , glancing down at the stained tunic on the bed . "" Open it now , sir , "" said West to the doctor , who took out his knife again , slit the cloth , and drew out the big letter , terribly soaked with its bearer's blood . "" Bravo ! Brave messenger ! "" cried the Commandant , grasping West's hand before tearing open the packet and finding enough of the despatch unstained to allow him to decipher the principal part of the text . "" Hah ! "" he cried , when he had finished , "" on the whole good news ; but , "" he continued , glancing at the date , "" you have been a long time coming . "" "" Have I , sir ? We lost no time ! "" "" The poor fellow has been lying here for a fortnight , sir , "" said the surgeon . "" A fortnight ago ? Why , that was the day when the reconnoitring party returned with the captured sheep and cattle . Yes , I remember now : they had a brush with the Boers up the river . Of course , yes : they were attracted by the firing , and saved two young Englishmen . You are one of them ? "" "" Yes , sir . "" "" Well done , then ! Our raiding party did good work , though they did have a desperate fight afterwards to get through the Boer lines . Getting better ? "" "" Yes , sir , "" said West , with a sigh of relief : "" now that I have got my despatch safely into your hands ! "" "" But what about your bad character ? "" "" It was a false accusation , sir ! "" cried West indignantly . "" The man who denounced me was the criminal himself . "" "" Well , you have done your duty so truly that I believe you in preference to him . "" "" But I shall be able to fully clear myself , sir , soon , for this man is a prisoner now with the cavalry brigade . Has that come into the town yet , sir , with the prisoners , guns , and the convoy they captured ? "" "" Hah ! "" cried the Commandant : "" this is news indeed ! Has the brigade captured all you say ? "" "" Yes , sir , "" said West , and he told all that had taken place up to the time of he and Ingleborough being cut off and chased by the Boers . "" We knew nothing of this ! "" said the Commandant . "" We are prisoners ourselves ; but your news gives us hope of a speedy release , for the General is not one to let the grass grow under his feet . "" "" He is not , sir ! "" said West . "" Then you shall bring me and the man who accused me face to face . "" "" The sooner the better , my lad ! "" said the Commandant warmly . "" How soon will he be up , doctor ? "" "" Within a fortnight , I hope , sir ! "" was the reply . "" Then goodbye for the present , my lad ! "" said the Commandant . "" Your long-delayed despatch will send a thrill of hope through all here in Kimberley , for it breathes nothing but determination to hold the Boers at bay . "" "" May I say one word more , sir ? "" said West excitedly . "" What do you think , doctor ? "" "" He has said enough , sir , and if he talks much more we shall have the fever back . Well , perhaps he 'll fret if he does not get something off his mind . "" "" What is it , then ? "" said the Commandant . "" I had a brave comrade to ride with the despatch , sir . "" "" To be sure , yes , I remember . What about him ? Not killed , I hope ? "" "" No , sir , but badly wounded , and lying somewhere here . "" "" Poor fellow ! I must see him . There must be promotion for you both . "" "" If you would see him , sir , and speak to him as you have spoken to me , "" said West , with the weak tears rising to his eyes . "" Of course , yes ! There , shake hands , my lad : you have done splendidly ! Do n't worry about the diamond charge ! I can feel that it was a contemptible lie ! Now , doctor , take me to your other patient . "" "" Ha ! "" sighed West , nestling back on his pillow with a calm look of content in his eyes , which closed directly after for a sleep that lasted ten hours at the least . | Next chapter | | Previous chapter | | Contents | E-Books created from nineteenth century or early twentieth century texts by Athelstane E-Texts .",8,8

" (We Want) The Same Thing  is a song by the American singer Belinda Carlisle . Written by Rick Nowels and Ellen Shipley , it was produced by Nowels for Carlisle's third album Runaway Horses (1989). It was released as the album's sixth and final single in the UK on October 2, 1990. To help promote the single in the UK, Virgin Records released a deluxe 12"" vinyl boxed set with free stickers, and a picture disc CD-single, in addition to standard formats. The single peaked at number six on the UK singles chart and spent ten weeks in the top 75. [ 1 ] Contents The single version of ""(We Want) The Same Thing"" is drastically different from the original version found on the album Runaway Horses . While the album version has a heavily accented punk rock staccato sound, the single version was changed into an powerful pop anthem; one of her most successful to date. The intro of the single version is notable for its chants of 'Hey!' repeated four times before a drum piece introduces the song. In the Runaway Horses album booklet, the lyrics listed for ""(We Want) The Same Thing"" vary from the actual version on the album though they match the lyrics for the single version. I look in your eyes and I know deep inside that We want the same thing So let's break the chains that Just make us insane 'cause We want the same thing Hey what's the problem here Can we negotiate I want to kiss your lips Before it's too late... I look in your eyes and I know deep inside that We want the same thing Breakin the chains that Just keep us in shame 'cause We want the same thing No matter what we say No matter what we do Beyond the battlelines Baby, we know what's true...

Annex International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Preamble The States Parties to this Convention , Considering the obligation of States under the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms , Having regard to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , Recalling the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the other relevant international instruments in the fields of human rights , humanitarian law and international criminal law , Also recalling the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its resolution 47 / 133 of 18 December 1992 , Aware of the extreme seriousness of enforced disappearance , which constitutes a crime and , in certain circumstances defined in international law , a crime against humanity , Determined to prevent enforced disappearances and to combat impunity for the crime of enforced disappearance , Considering the right of any person not to be subjected to enforced disappearance , the right of victims to justice and to reparation , Affirming the right of any victim to know the truth about the circumstances of an enforced disappearance and the fate of the disappeared person , and the right to freedom to seek , receive and impart information to this end , Have agreed on the following articles : Part I Article 1 No one shall be subjected to enforced disappearance . No exceptional circumstances whatsoever , whether a state of war or a threat of war , internal political instability or any other public emergency , may be invoked as a justification for enforced disappearance . Article 2 For the purposes of this Convention , "" enforced disappearance "" is considered to be the arrest , detention , abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization , support or acquiescence of the State , followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person , which places such a person outside the protection of the law . Article 3 Each State Party shall take appropriate measures to investigate acts defined in article 2 committed by persons or groups of persons acting without the authorization , support or acquiescence of the State and to bring those responsible to justice . Article 4 Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an offence under its criminal law . Article 5 The widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined in applicable international law and shall attract the consequences provided for under such applicable international law . Article 6 Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to hold criminally responsible at least : ( a ) Any person who commits , orders , solicits or induces the commission of , attempts to commit , is an accomplice to or participates in an enforced disappearance ; ( b ) A superior who : ( i ) Knew , or consciously disregarded information which clearly indicated , that subordinates under his or her effective authority and control were committing or about to commit a crime of enforced disappearance ; ( ii ) Exercised effective responsibility for and control over activities which were concerned with the crime of enforced disappearance ; and ( iii ) Failed to take all necessary and reasonable measures within his or her power to prevent or repress the commission of an enforced disappearance or to submit the matter to the competent authorities for investigation and prosecution ; ( c ) Subparagraph ( b ) above is without prejudice to the higher standards of responsibility applicable under relevant international law to a military commander or to a person effectively acting as a military commander . No order or instruction from any public authority , civilian , military or other , may be invoked to justify an offence of enforced disappearance . Article 7 Each State Party shall make the offence of enforced disappearance punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account its extreme seriousness . Each State Party may establish : ( a ) Mitigating circumstances , in particular for persons who , having been implicated in the commission of an enforced disappearance , effectively contribute to bringing the disappeared person forward alive or make it possible to clarify cases of enforced disappearance or to identify the perpetrators of an enforced disappearance ; ( b ) Without prejudice to other criminal procedures , aggravating circumstances , in particular in the event of the death of the disappeared person or the commission of an enforced disappearance in respect of pregnant women , minors , persons with disabilities or other particularly vulnerable persons . Article 8 Without prejudice to article 5 , A State Party which applies a statute of limitations in respect of enforced disappearance shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the term of limitation for criminal proceedings : ( a ) Is of long duration and is proportionate to the extreme seriousness of this offence ; ( b ) Commences from the moment when the offence of enforced disappearance ceases , taking into account its continuous nature . Each State Party shall guarantee the right of victims of enforced disappearance to an effective remedy during the term of limitation . Article 9 Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to establish its competence to exercise jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance : ( a ) When the offence is committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State ; ( b ) When the alleged offender is one of its nationals ; ( c ) When the disappeared person is one of its nationals and the State Party considers it appropriate . Each State Party shall likewise take such measures as may be necessary to establish its competence to exercise jurisdiction over the offence of enforced disappearance when the alleged offender is present in any territory under its jurisdiction , unless it extradites or surrenders him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrenders him or her to an international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognized . This Convention does not exclude any additional criminal jurisdiction exercised in accordance with national law . Article 10 Upon being satisfied , after an examination of the information available to it , that the circumstances so warrant , any State Party in whose territory a person suspected of having committed an offence of enforced disappearance is present shall take him or her into custody or take such other legal measures as are necessary to ensure his or her presence . The custody and other legal measures shall be as provided for in the law of that State Party but may be maintained only for such time as is necessary to ensure the person's presence at criminal , surrender or extradition proceedings . A State Party which has taken the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall immediately carry out a preliminary inquiry or investigations to establish the facts . It shall notify the States Parties referred to in article 9 , paragraph 1 , of the measures it has taken in pursuance of paragraph 1 of this article , including detention and the circumstances warranting detention , and of the findings of its preliminary inquiry or its investigations , indicating whether it intends to exercise its jurisdiction . Any person in custody pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article may communicate immediately with the nearest appropriate representative of the State of which he or she is a national , or , if he or she is a stateless person , with the representative of the State where he or she usually resides . Article 11 The State Party in the territory under whose jurisdiction a person alleged to have committed an offence of enforced disappearance is found shall , if it does not extradite that person or surrender him or her to another State in accordance with its international obligations or surrender him or her to an international criminal tribunal whose jurisdiction it has recognized , submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution . These authorities shall take their decision in the same manner as in the case of any ordinary offence of a serious nature under the law of that State Party . In the cases referred to in article 9 , paragraph 2 , the standards of evidence required for prosecution and conviction shall in no way be less stringent than those which apply in the cases referred to in article 9 , paragraph 1 . Any person against whom proceedings are brought in connection with an offence of enforced disappearance shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the proceedings . Any person tried for an offence of enforced disappearance shall benefit from a fair trial before a competent , independent and impartial court or tribunal established by law . Article 12 Each State Party shall ensure that any individual who alleges that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance has the right to report the facts to the competent authorities , which shall examine the allegation promptly and impartially and , where necessary , undertake without delay a thorough and impartial investigation . Appropriate steps shall be taken , where necessary , to ensure that the complainant , witnesses , relatives of the disappeared person and their defence counsel , as well as persons participating in the investigation , are protected against all ill-treatment or intimidation as a consequence of the complaint or any evidence given . Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person has been subjected to enforced disappearance , the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of this article shall undertake an investigation , even if there has been no formal complaint . Each State Party shall ensure that the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 of this article : ( a ) Have the necessary powers and resources to conduct the investigation effectively , including access to the documentation and other information relevant to their investigation ; ( b ) Have access , if necessary with the prior authorization of a judicial authority , which shall rule promptly on the matter , to any place of detention or any other place where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the disappeared person may be present . Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to prevent and sanction acts that hinder the conduct of an investigation . It shall ensure in particular that persons suspected of having committed an offence of enforced disappearance are not in a position to influence the progress of an investigation by means of pressure or acts of intimidation or reprisal aimed at the complainant , witnesses , relatives of the disappeared person or their defence counsel , or at persons participating in the investigation . Article 13 For the purposes of extradition between States Parties , the offence of enforced disappearance shall not be regarded as a political offence or as an offence connected with a political offence or as an offence inspired by political motives . Accordingly , a request for extradition based on such an offence may not be refused on these grounds alone . The offence of enforced disappearance shall be deemed to be included as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty existing between States Parties before the entry into force of this Convention . States Parties undertake to include the offence of enforced disappearance as an extraditable offence in any extradition treaty subsequently to be concluded between them . If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty , it may consider this Convention as the necessary legal basis for extradition in respect of the offence of enforced disappearance . States Parties which do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall recognize the offence of enforced disappearance as an extraditable offence between themselves . Extradition shall , in all cases , be subject to the conditions provided for by the law of the requested State Party or by applicable extradition treaties , including , in particular , conditions relating to the minimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse extradition or make it subject to certain conditions . Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person's sex , race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin , political opinions or membership of a particular social group , or that compliance with the request would cause harm to that person for any one of these reasons . Article 14 States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of mutual legal assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect of an offence of enforced disappearance , including the supply of all evidence at their disposal that is necessary for the proceedings . Such mutual legal assistance shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested State Party or by applicable treaties on mutual legal assistance , including , in particular , the conditions in relation to the grounds upon which the requested State Party may refuse to grant mutual legal assistance or may make it subject to conditions . Article 15 States Parties shall cooperate with each other and shall afford one another the greatest measure of mutual assistance with a view to assisting victims of enforced disappearance , and in searching for , locating and releasing disappeared persons and , in the event of death , in exhuming and identifying them and returning their remains . Article 16 No State Party shall expel , return ( "" refouler "" ) , surrender or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to enforced disappearance . For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds , the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations , including , where applicable , the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross , flagrant or mass violations of human rights or of serious violations of international humanitarian law . Article 17 No one shall be held in secret detention . Without prejudice to other international obligations of the State Party with regard to the deprivation of liberty , each State Party shall , in its legislation : ( a ) Establish the conditions under which orders of deprivation of liberty may be given ; ( b ) Indicate those authorities authorized to order the deprivation of liberty ; ( c ) Guarantee that any person deprived of liberty shall be held solely in officially recognized and supervised places of deprivation of liberty ; ( d ) Guarantee that any person deprived of liberty shall be authorized to communicate with and be visited by his or her family , counsel or any other person of his or her choice , subject only to the conditions established by law , or , if he or she is a foreigner , to communicate with his or her consular authorities , in accordance with applicable international law ; ( e ) Guarantee access by the competent and legally authorized authorities and institutions to the places where persons are deprived of liberty , if necessary with prior authorization from a judicial authority ; ( f ) Guarantee that any person deprived of liberty or , in the case of a suspected enforced disappearance , since the person deprived of liberty is not able to exercise this right , any persons with a legitimate interest , such as relatives of the person deprived of liberty , their representatives or their counsel , shall , in all circumstances , be entitled to take proceedings before a court , in order that the court may decide without delay on the lawfulness of the deprivation of liberty and order the person's release if such deprivation of liberty is not lawful . Each State Party shall assure the compilation and maintenance of one or more up-to-date official registers and / or records of persons deprived of liberty , which shall be made promptly available , upon request , to any judicial or other competent authority or institution authorized for that purpose by the law of the State Party concerned or any relevant international legal instrument to which the State concerned is a party .

Article 19 Personal information , including medical and genetic data , which is collected and / or transmitted within the framework of the search for a disappeared person shall not be used or made available for purposes other than the search for the disappeared person . This is without prejudice to the use of such information in criminal proceedings relating to an offence of enforced disappearance or the exercise of the right to obtain reparation . The collection , processing , use and storage of personal information , including medical and genetic data , shall not infringe or have the effect of infringing the human rights , fundamental freedoms or human dignity of an individual .

"Real Estate Information Archive Blog Question : Allison , I heard that Congress recently changed some of the capital gains laws . What have you heard ? Answer : Hardly anybody noticed it , but Congress tucked away a valuable bit of holiday cheer for real estate when it passed its final tax bill of the year . It was the first substantive change in years to the generous capital gains rules governing sales of principal homes . According to Kenneth Harney , most homeowners and real estate professionals can recite these rules in their sleep : Married , joint-filing sellers of houses can exclude up to $ 500 , 000 of gain , and single-filing sellers can take up to $ 250 , 000 ... provided they 've used the property as a principal residence for a cumulative two of the previous five years . But what happens when a married home owner dies ? Does the surviving spouse still qualify for the full $ 500 , 000 -- or does she or he only get to exclude $ 250 , 000 ? The answer from the IRS has been this : you only get the full $ 500 , 000 if you sell during the tax year in which you were married and filing a joint return . Otherwise , the tax code sees you as single , and then you 're limited to $ 250 , 000 . In other words , if your wife or husband died in June of 2007 , you can only claim the full $ 500 , 000 benefit if you sell before December 31 , 2007 . After that , as long as you remain unmarried , you 're capped at the $ 250 , 000 limit for single taxpayers . As a practical matter , most surviving spouses inherit their husband's or wife's share of the property at what 's known as a "" stepped up "" tax basis , with no capital gains tax liability at the current market value . Well , now they 've got it . Legislation signed into law before the holiday recess gives surviving spouses two full years to qualify for the $ 500 , 000 exclusion -- even though technically they 're single . And who says Congress does n't have a heart ? Since your tax professional may not be familiar with this yet , here 's the official citation : The bill is H.R. 3648 . The capital gains change is in Section 7 . Question : Our goal for this next year is to buy a home in Summit County . We want to get some information on financing and are considering using an Internet lender . What would be the benefits of working with someone locally versus working with an Internet lender ? Answer : There are numerous advantages when using a local mortgage lender as compared to a mortgage lender obtained over the Internet . Customer service is the number one advantage . A local mortgage lender is familiar with the properties in their area , whereas an Internet lender may have limited knowledge of the requirements associated with a resort area . With a local lender the borrowers will have an individual who is personally working on their loan application , as every borrower's needs and financial situations are unique . The borrower also has a contact person to check the status of their application and to answer any questions they may have . Plus they will be able to speak directly with a local lender without having to play phone tag or leaving messages in voice mail that can be associated with the larger mortgage corporations . This can be frustrating to the borrowers . The lender is responsible for ordering the appraisal on the property , which should be from a local appraiser . This is very important . A local appraiser is familiar with the area and the values of the properties and any changes in the area that can affect those values . When purchasing a condominium unit , local lenders will be familiar with the condominium projects in the area and will know if the project meets the lender's requirements . There is also the working relationship with the local title companies , surveyors and insurance companies to meet the state's requirements to provide each borrower with clear title to the property . There are several steps that must be completed to take a borrower from application to approval to the closing date . Working with the local mortgage lenders , title companies , appraisers and surveyors makes all these steps come together . You have the advantage of the individuals familiar not only with the area but also the requirements of each purchase contract . Purchasing a home whether it 's your first home , vacation home or a rental property can be stressful , working with your local professionals can make this process a lot easier . Question : Our Realtor has suggested that we hire an interior decorator to "" stage "" our home . Is there any benefit in this ? Answer : Originally popularized in California , staging helps homes sell quickly and for more money . Staging concentrates not on changing the interior in terms of painting or adding carpeting , says Carole Talbott of home decorating company Visual Coordinations . These are things the buyers would most likely prefer to choose themselves . Rather staging depends on "" selling the space . "" When a home is staged , it 's reorganized--first with the furniture , then artwork , and finally by accessories . The furnishings remain the same , except for well-worn pieces or those that break up the design . Many times accessories are used to add color to a room . Stagers charge approximately $ 500 to $ 750 for a three-bedroom , two-bath home ; Talbott advises owners to stage only the main living areas to avoid high costs . Some staging advice for homeowners who want to go it alone : furniture should be kept away from walls by grouping at angles in the middle of the room ; colors should be chosen from artwork and fabrics , and accessories should be chosen to accentuate them ; collections should be kept together ; and mirrors should be placed in locations where favorable scenery will reflect . To attract attention to the exterior , the front door should be the first thing painted or decorated . Question : I am thinking of buying a condominium in Summit County and want to find a property with low homeowner's association dues . How important is it for the association to have a capital reserve fund ? Answer : Condominium buyers should be wary of associations that lack adequate reserves--money set aside to pay for emergency or major repairs--because they could be forced to pay special assessments to cover costs when the association can not . Additionally , a future sale or refinancing could be denied based on the association's reserves ; and it is difficult to find a buyer under such conditions . Insufficient reserve funds can lead to declining property values , as educated buyers refrain from purchasing condos in the community , according to the Community Associations Institute , a national nonprofit organization that educates and provides resources to homeowner groups . Annually , an association's board of directors is required to predict the next year's income and expenses--usually through a reserve analysis study . This report consists of a property evaluation--architectural and engineering--by qualified engineers . The engineers determine the useful life and repair costs of things like boilers , elevators , and roofs to determine how much money should be set aside each year to plan for future replacement . The reserve funds are generally collected from the condo owners on a monthly or quarterly basis and deposited into Treasury bills or other secure government-insured funds . If a repair is necessary and the association needs to raise the money immediately , there are three steps it can take : increase the monthly assessment amount ; impose special assessments , in which the owner immediately pays a fee based on the percentage interest he / she has in the association ( sometimes amounting to hundreds of dollars ) ; or get a loan . Answer : Although reverse mortgages are an ideal fit for many senior homeowners , they are not the best option for all of them . A reverse mortgage would not be in the best interest of someone who intends to make a move in the foreseeable future , the AARP and other sources note . Reverse loans usually come with stiff upfront fees and closing costs of up to 10 percent of the loan amount , which are distributed over the life of the loan . Owners who sell their homes quickly will also lose their equity quickly . Reverse mortgages may not be suitable for seniors who want to leave a free-and-clear property behind as a legacy to their heirs . At the same time , some experts say elderly homeowners should consider a reverse loan as a way to meet living expenses or settle medical bills while they are alive , without worrying about what will happen when they die . Their offspring still can keep the property by paying off the reverse mortgage with funds from the estate or with their own money , or by taking out a new mortgage . Experts warn that reverse loans may not be the solution for the youngest seniors , because longer life expectancy qualifies borrowers for less money , or for those in the midst of a temporary financial emergency , who might be better off taking out a home equity line instead . Finally , another alternative , such as selling the property and using the proceeds to downsize into a smaller house or to rent , might make sense for some seniors . Question : Allison , we 've heard a lot about 1031 tax-deferred exchanges and would like to know if our second home would qualify for a like-kind exchange with another piece of property that is closer to our home . We have never rented our current property , but consider it an investment due to it 's appreciation the past few years . Answer : Your question is a good one – and one that has been in the media and in the courts quite a bit in the past few months . To get an accurate assessment of your particular situation , I recommend you speak with a company that specializes in 1031 tax-deferred exchanges . According to Inman News , a similar case to yours was tried in court . Here are the details . In 1988 Barry and Deborah Moore purchased a second home on Clark Hill Lake . It included a home to which the Moores added a deck and other improvements . The property was a three-hour drive from their principal residence . The Moores and their children visited the property two weekends each month between April and September each year . But in 1995 the Moores changed their primary-residence location , making the drive to the Clark Hill Lake property a five - to six-hour trip . As a result , they used the property only a few times each summer . The Clark Hill Lake property was never offered for rent to short - or long-term tenants . On their income-tax returns , the Moores deducted their mortgage interest and property tax payments as personal itemized deductions . In 2000 , the Moores found a five-bedroom , four-bathroom house on 1.2 acres of land adjoining Lake Lanier , just a few hours from their home . It has five screened-in porches , a party deck and veranda . They decided to make an Internal Revenue Code 1031 tax-deferred trade of the Clark Hill Lake property for the larger and closer Lake Lanier property . They justified the exchange by stating both properties were held for "" investment "" rather than for personal use . Upon audit , the IRS denied the IRC 1031 tax-deferral on the sale of the Clark Hill Lake property . The IRS auditor noted the property had never been rented and was used only by the Moore family on weekends . But the Moores argued they held the property as an investment for future appreciation in market value . They took their dispute to the U.S. Tax Court . If you were the judge would you allow the Moores to defer the capital gains tax on the trade of the Clark Hill Lake property as an investment ? The judge said no ! To qualify for an IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange , the judge began , both properties involved in the trade must be held for investment or for use in a trade or business . Although the Moores pointed to the appreciation potential of the Clark Hill Lake property , he continued , "" It is a taxpayer's primary purpose in holding the properties that counts . "" "" Property held for investment is property held for the production of income , "" the judge explained . "" We accept as fact the Moores hoped that both the Clark Hill and Lake Lanier properties would appreciate , "" he noted . "" Mere hope or expectation that property may be sold at a gain can not establish an investment intent if the taxpayer uses the property as a residence , "" the judge emphasized . There was no convincing proof either property was held for the production of income as a rental since the family used both properties primarily as vacation retreats , he added . Because the evidence strongly showed both vacation homes were held for personal use , rather than for production of income , neither property qualifies for an IRC 1031 tax-deferred exchange , and the Clark Hill Lake property sale is taxable , the judge ruled .",2,5

"I Will Survive: Enjoyable And Entertaining TV by Reality Raver It was a risky move by Network Ten to make a show with a cast of mainly all men who in fact take on female roles as well by dressing up in drag, as they recreate the iconic journey of Priscilla Queen of the Desert . The show is looking for the next big musical theatre star, someone who can dance, sing and act with a nice $250,000 for the winner plus a month in New York. Unfortunately it did not rate well, with a low 506,000, and this could have been due to late scheduling changes or just a current lack of faith in the Network to produce a good TV show. It deserved to be watched by more. The show was slick, entertaining and well edited, and there was some talent there both with the boys who will end up being eliminated one by one, and the judges. One of my concerns was that all the talent was going to be male due to the nature of the show they were recreating, however that ended up not being a negative thing. Stephan Elliott the director of the original movie apparently made the Network put him on as a judge according to a interview he had with TV Tonight , and boy they were lucky he did. It was refreshing to see someone who was not going to edit the real him just because he was on a TV show, and he was the stand out judge and looks like he was not going to pull any punches with the contestants. The show started off a drag show at the iconic drag venue, the Imperial Hotel, where the guys did a farewell show for friends and family. Hopefully by the time they get frocked up again most of them will have found a razor or a pot of wax. No drag queen would ever be seen on stage with hairy armpits or chest. Then it was off to Dubbo to sing for the judges, Stephan, Jason Donovan and Rachael Taylor. What was interesting when Jason was critiquing Davin who did a great rendition of I Am What I Am he described him as being to camp. Did he not get the memo that the show was Priscilla Queen of The Desert not Pirates of Penzance. Rachael told him as they were sitting in the sequin glitz of the bus, ""look around"" in the end Davin avoided the bottom three. However if it is going to be camp they should embrace it. What slightly annoyed me last night was the continual showcasing of how blokey these guys were, with there jobs truck driving, working in mines, and kicking footballs. Maybe this is to set up the comedy of these Aussie blokes having to frock up. However at the Imperial we were introduced to the girlfriends and sisters but there were no boyfriends or guy buddies there. Stephan also revealed to TV Tonight that at one stage they were talking about not doing drag. Thankfully that did not occur. They need to embrace the camp. Hopefully as the show goes on we will get more of all the guys back stories. The highlights were Tom Sharah who has buckets of charisma and talent. He was a younger version of performer Paul Capsis, and in fact apparently does one man caberet shows as well. This kid is a star. Adrian Espulo got great feedback from the judges from his solo, and is he being set up to be the show's heart throb. However I thought his girlfriend Veronica was hotter. For the record she is my daughter's dance teacher, so I won't be shit bagging her boyfriend to ensure she does not get buried up the back of the stage at the end of year concert! Luna Park performer Sean Perez was struggling with a cold so he did not sound fabulous, but hopefully we will get to see what he can do when he is 100% well. Matt McFarlane was unlucky to be bottom three even though he did a musical version of Save Me by Queen, at least he was in tune, something that could not be said of Frank Kerr whose performance was very average indeed. Hopefully once the nerves drop we will see stronger performances. Former Hi-5 performer Nathan was in there continuing with his staple head flick, this might excite some of the mums that were groupies when he was doing kids TV, but I hope Stephan knocks that out of him. However he has a very strong voice, something people with kids will already know but he will have the problem of people seeing him in a new way. It was a good fast paced episode and as the series unfold hopefully we will get to know more about these boys and see some serious talent on our screens. I Will Survive is on Network TEN Tuesday and Wednesday nights at 7.30pm. Tom and Davin were indeed the stand out performances for me. A bit of a shame Matt ended up in the bottom 3 as I thought his performance was quite good, but I agreed with Sean and Frank being put in there as they're perfomances were weak. I think Frank will be eliminated tonight. All in all this ws a good start to what I think will be a very entertaining show. Hopefully the ratings will improve although it will be tough as it has to compete against Big Brother and X-Factor. I really enjoyed it and it's sad it has quite a 'narrow' audience it seems. I thought it would rate more as well. They need to yank it out of that X Factor/Big Brother space -- maybe air it a bit later? It would be a shame if they have to send it to second station hell. Also it's partly up against Farmer Wants a Wife tonight -- I'm torn as I want to see Hard On Boofhead Farmer and what he says or does to that lassy. Might record it -- arugh but then I can't twitter -- ARUGH! Dear Channels -- stop putting the shows all up against each other -- space them out you bastards! You make live tweeting near impossible. Oh, and to me Davin was the stand out. Rachel wasn't the only one blushing. That voice is pure gold. This was so GOOD! I noted nasty Nine put up a double episode of Boring Bogan to hamper it's debut. Hope Ten give it a decent timeslot, and a decent chance. Repeat this on Sunday night instead of the other repeats/crap brought in to replace EDN, Ten. LOVED IT! & Adrian what a STAR! I was with Rachael all the way when she said 'think I may be blushing' he is the stand out for me as he is there to learn & mold & that is what its all about. The winner needs to be someone who can evolve, not someone who has done it all before & definitely NOT someone who has already made a successful career from a franchise in the past albeit a kids franchise. He should be out there promoting himself, not using another TV show to further his career & certainly not when there is $250k at stake! What is his agent doing? RR, I caught this show out of curiousity. It does have potential but I actually thought there was something amiss with the editing. Maybe tonight's episode will gel how the two-episode per week format will go -- (i.e. will tonight's bootcamp, etc, be a precursor to the dance/sing/act for your life episode next Tuesday?). Because the format is new, I'm prepared to stick around for a little while longer. What I enjoyed with this show were seeing how good these seasoned performers really are. I've seen Jersey Boys and apart from the overdone accent that made Snooki sound like she's reciting Shakespere on Jeresey Shore, Stephen should be one to look out for. I also enjoyed how brave several of the performers were in choosing to sing soulful songs rather than brassy musical numbers. Due to his illness, Sean sounded flat and Frank was so nervous, I couldn't get past how much he gesticulated -- like an Italian grandmother on speed. I also thought the guy who sang that David Bowie song ended up shouting at times when trying to hit the higher registers. I know Jason made a comment about Davin being too camp but I think Jason has a point. When this show commenced production, the prize of performing in Priscilla on Broadway no longer became an option with the show closing. A triple-threat needs to be able to stand-out and show some range. The challenge for Tom, Nathan, and Davin is to reign in those little ticks (hair flicks) and hand gestures that may work in cabaret and performing kids variety shows, but will be extremely irritating to see constantly in a musical. Stephan and Jason look like they are prepared to be blunt with the contestants so that is a plus. I hope future challenges will show off the acting and dancing aspect of this show a bit more. Tonight, I expect the radio announcer from Tasmania to go home. He seemed so intimidated by everyone else. This is a shame as it would be nice to see an amateur make it deep in the competition.

"Women in focus : Crime and justice The police returned details on 26,000 incidents of domestic abuse recorded between April and December 1999 . However , the majority of incidents recorded ( 57 % ) comprised behaviour that did not lead to the recording of a crime or offence . If an incidence of domestic abuse did lead to a crime or offence being recorded , the most common occurrence was a recording of an offence of petty assault ( 21 % of all incidents ) or breach of the peace ( 18 % of all incidents ) . Crimes which are generally regarded as more serious than offences , were only recorded in respect of 5 % of all incidents . Where a crime was recorded , it was likely to be vandalism ( 1 . 6 % of all incidents ) or , a non-sexual crime of violence ( 1 . 5 % of all incidents ) . Males accounted for 87 % of all convictions in 1999 : more males than females were convicted for almost all crime and offence categories . The main exception to this was "" other "" crimes of indecency , where females accounted for 82 % of what are mainly offences related to prostitution . The other categories where females formed a higher than average proportion of those convicted included shoplifting ( 28 % ) , "" other theft "" ( 21 % ) , and the "" other "" miscellaneous offences category ( 15 % ) . The latter category mainly relates to non-payment of a television licence . These three categories accounted for 13 % , 7 % and 7 % respectively of all ; convictions for females : the corresponding proportions for males were 5 % , 4 % and 6 % .",4,1
"It's true love between the Democratic president and the Republican governor of New Jersey. More than a week after President Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie toured sections of the Jersey Shore ravaged by Superstorm Sandy, the White House remains ""stunned"" at how helpful Christie and his team have been and how easy it is to work with them, The Post has learned. ""The Christie people are so much easier to deal with than the Cuomo people,"" a senior administration official said, referring to Gov. Cuomo. ""New York wants to do everything alone, but we're working with Christie really well. It's weird."" Obama has ordered every Cabinet member -- except Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- ""to go up there [to New Jersey] at least once for Christie,"" the source said. ",4,4
"share this story The smoke has seemingly cleared from the streets of London, though I still get messages via Facebook from concerned friends and relatives outside of the UK worried that I'm so close to the action. I reassure them with jokes like ""they only riot over a lack of good pinot in Barnes"" making light of a tragedy that's left behind at least five dead. But sometimes you need to use humour because the reality is too uncomfortable to stomach. As I type you can still here sirens and my guess is it isn't an RTA. My worry is that this will be forgotten as quickly as the violence erupted, that it'll become the digital equivalent of chip paper, discarded and disposable content. My view is that this country has changed forever and was in dire need of it, the issue now is how we make good of the bad. I'm not a apologist for criminal behaviour, it has to be condemned but lets not be hypocritical about this either, it cuts both ways. For too long we've buried our heads and dismissed them as chavs but within British society we've allowed this to happen. Attending a sink school doesn't inspire anyone and lacking in role models within their own communities they'd be hard pushed to find ones outside. All they see now is that criminality doesn't stop beyond the estate. Bankers are getting paid, MPs are getting paid, Police are getting paid and also getting away with it so why shouldn't they. It's a ""money for nothing society"" fueled by a sense of entitlement that runs across the social strata. We've had years of state sponsored greed, served up by both the Conservatives and Labour.... and they want foreigners to take citizenship tests? Many people in the detention centres have a clearer idea of our individual responsibilities to society that some Brits do! The social contract that our welfare state was built on has been so gradually chipped away at that it's now in tatters. It's true there are thousands of people who live in these inner city communities who have the same background as the rioters and similar prospects who don't smash up their neighbourhoods. But the ""mindless yobs"" had no problem smashing up local businesses and enjoyed it because when you've never been given boundaries and have no values you have no respect for the law, you see nothing in taking and destroying other people's property. They've been doing this in their areas since before they got into secondary school so why should anything change once they're mobilized into a mob. They upped the ante but in truth the destruction of these communities didn't start last weekend, it's been crumbling over generations. For many they have never seen work as an option and even if they did they'd be doing jobs that would barely make it worthwhile. They've seen criminality or breaking the established rules as part of life's game and what's worse they see those charged with leading the nation to be just as bent as them. Class is still an issue in this country and there's always been a top down component to it. In the past people knew their place but now that no longer exists. Years ago I spoke to a man who had been on the Jarrow March during the dark days of the 1930's depression. I asked why the people didn't revolt. His reply was that wasn't the British way. The rise of a more individual some would say more narcissistic society has long removed the leash, with people no longer deferential to their betters who set an even worse example. The short selling on currencies that undermine our national livelihoods by those eager to make profit at the expense of others through to MP's fiddling expenses is all part of a trend that ignores the wider society and puts the individual above all else. My gratification is more important than your welfare is the message that is force fed to all in our society. These young men and women were not robbing shops to send a message to society they wanted a new handset or a pair of trainers. But they've communicated a lot through their actions. It showed that there's a problem that's cross generational, cross gender and cross race. Poor people in this country do not have a voice especially the white working class. They have no community leaders and the only time you see them on telly is on a reality TV show or as angry vox pops about immigration. There is no democratic forum to change this - voting seems a waste of time as the power exists to only further the rich and powerful. These"" mindless yobs"" can see a con a mile off - the longer we pretend there's meritocracy, the worse it will get. The senseless loss of life is tragic but if these riots had remained in the poorer parts of the country and hadn't spread it'd only have be covered by the ethnic press, the microscope wouldn't have been turned on the wider society. Now it's a chance to reflect on where it's gone wrong. Thing's change after riots, look at the Poll Tax riots. The press was full of words like appalled, condemn and increase police powers. And what was the upshot? The Poll Tax was scrapped. We can blame the parents all we like but part of the responsibility lies with us all. Taking back your community doesn't start with helping to clean up but simply trying to put back what we all take out. Loading comments... To paraphrase Thatcher, ""There is no such thing as society, only individuals."" Reagan similarly endorsed a breaking of the social contract. Young people were criminalized en masse with draconian drug laws that overstuffed our prisons. The mentally ill were dumped on the streets as hospitals closed. Real wages declined. Workplace and environmental protections were removed. Education was defunded. Social security taxes skyrocketed on everyone but the rich. The public good was left to charity and to whatever ""trickled down."" Perfect meritocracy was declared. It wasn't long until we had the L.A. riots. But it was inevitable. In a society in which large numbers of people are slipping permanently behind and treated with not even so much as compassion or understanding, but rather loathing and contempt for it; when anyone with money is treated as having a higher order of consciousness and morality -- where is the social contract? ""We're all in this together,"" the world wars made us say, and believe -- but that changed to ""I got mine -- get yours!"" And to the devil with you if you don't. When society treats you as invisible, expendable, and contemptible -- where is the impetus to do well or do right? Or even to hope? When the stakeholders in a society are all at the top, the bottom has no stake in order. It may be that very order that demeans and condemns them and fights hardest against them. It should come as no surprise when societies reap what they Loading comments... I haven't seen any posts in the last few days I've agreed with more than this. Davis's piece is just the kind of wider base we need as a society to go from to sort things out. Much more of use to the wider discussion than Dr Starkey's comments. I hope that social debate will stem from this and we may be able to build a more meritocrious society. ",5,5

"Villagers in Shipley think someone has been stealing their water and spiriting it away in dawn raids . Officials believe gallons of the local supply have been surreptitiously syphoned from a hydrant into a road tanker . Yorkshire Water has launched an investigation after residents complained about disruption to supplies . The problem , in the Nab Wood area , is believed to have been caused by someone tapping into the mains without permission , says a councillor . Water bosses have enlisted the help of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea in an attempt to track down a vehicle which is thought to be linked to the problem . A spokesman for Yorkshire Water said : "" All businesses which require water in the street - such as street cleaners - need to hold a valid standpipe licence to take water without disrupting supplies to nearby premises . "" The licence ensures that only standpipes of the correct size can be used . "" We are aware of the issue in the Nab Wood area and have been making investigations to trace the person responsible for reducing the water supply to customers . "" We are currently awaiting details of the vehicle from the DVLA to help us in our investigations . "" We would like to assure customers in the area that we are doing everything possible to trace this vehicle . "" Councillor Martin Love ( Green , Shipley ) said : "" People have approached me to tell me about the problem , which was a bit of a mystery for a while . "" A lot of residents in Nab Wood found their water pressure was dropping every morning . It was happening at 7 . 30am every day . "" There is a theory someone with a tanker has been taking water from a hydrant . "" It went on for quite a few days and nobody was sure where the problem was coming from . "" I think it caused a quite a lot of disruption to people in that area . I have spoken to Yorkshire Water and they say they are onto it . "" Yorkshire Water said no problems had been reported in Nab Wood in recent days . It is believed the vehicle might have left the area and could now be operating elsewhere .

"i have my playbook since last Oct and keep waiting for the update on some asian languages to be implanted... i was counting on the new os 2.0 could fixed the problem... but now, really don't know how long have to wait??? can rim really do something there to review this issue? Totally agree. I am seriously going to replace my iPad with my new PlayBook because I really like the size and it's convenience. And it's way more elegant and beautiful (both exterior and the os) than android devices such as Samsung galaxy. But the lack of Chinese input prohibits me from doing so and I can't part with my ipad. This is really annoying. I hope the Asian input will be available soon! ",0,0
"Oct 15, 2012 10:28 PM So getting straight into it, about 2 years ago my grandad got diagnosed with stomach cancer, it was advanced at this point due to the fact he refused for 5 months prior to the diagnosis to see a doctor about his symptoms in the end leaving my nan forcing the doctor to talk with him about the serious symptoms. Due to the advanced stages the cancer was already spreading to his other organs and he quickly worsened, loosing 3 stone in 2 months etc etc. At this point the doctors told him it was terminal, which already was a shock to us all. We are such a close family, spending every weekend as a child at his house, he taught me how to cook, how to swim, he would sit and tell me stories from when he was younger. Hes the best man i have ever met. the doctors told us to prepare for the worse and say our goodbyes but 2 years later hes still here. So i guess i can say ive learnt to put the cancer to the back of my mind as in my head hes my big 6ft tall strong grandad who beat the doctors guesses. for the past 2 years chemo has kept the cancer under control and the 3st he lost has slowly come back , but recently hes lost it again and he cant eat or drink without being sick, hes off chemo and hes the worse ive seen him, he never leaves the house. Anyway, the reason im here is because i guess im lost, i was writing my list for christmas in terms of what i need to buy for others, i wrote everyone out but when i got to the word ""grampy"" my heart fell, i could not write anything, since then ive been a mess, we are waiting for results on whether its spread further, im constantly thinking about it, but i still wont talk to anyone i dont want to look weak i want to forget it like ive done in the past. i keep thinking he wont be here for chirstmas , and if he is it will be his last with us, I dont know how to deal with loosing a man who taught me so much about life, he wont see me graduate university which kills me. I cant understand cancer, i dont udnerstand half the stuff thats happened to him, hes never smoked or drank much, he used to run 1 mile every day, why iis someone who was so health concious now stuck in a chair unable to do anything. I feel i have no one to talk to or express my feelings to. And my biggest question of all, is it bad that i sometimes blame him for not getting checked out when the symptoms first started like i had pleaded with him to do? I guess ive bottled it up for 2 years and its got to the point i need to scream about it, i need to be upset, everyones telling me to spend time with him but i dont want to see him like this. Its killing me, i just need someone who understands to talk to, who isnt my family, thats why im here. Its an up and down battle that i dont know how to face anymore, its too far along for me to forget it like i have done in the past. Have just read your story and do understand how you feel. (My husband who is also a grandad to a 4 year old has terminal cancer). We all hate what cancer does to those we love and the emotions you are experiencing are perfectly acceptable. We have anger, sadness, frustration and many other emotions to deal with and I try to deal with them day by day and sometimes even hour by hour. There will be many on this forum who will feel as you do (maybe even some of a like age who can respond better than me).  Coping is so hard and you need to talk and ask questions as they arise which is why this site helps so many in our position.  I do hope that as your grandad has battled before and been well for a while that once again he can be helped to overcome his current battle too.  As a family we do not know how long my husband may have but plans for Christmas are still being formed and rightly or wrongly I believe he will be there with us and we are striving to make it as normal as we can. Do hope  you have some positive news soon and come back on forum to share your feelings. I find it helps to write them down.Jules54 Thank you for your reply, sorry to hear about your husband. Its a horrible horrible disease, past two years ive just tried to forget it and kept myself busy with other stuff and its got too much, thats why i came here Yeah im trying to stay positive but as everyone here understands its not easy. My main worry is what do i do if he cant battle it again like last time? Reading posts on here helps, i dont feel so alone i can see others are going through the same thing. Its easier to talk on here than to my family which is crazy! Jody Great to see that people are already helping you on this site and as you can see too there are people your own age who know exactly what you are experiencing. I found it difficult trying to cope with telling my kids but we all have different personalities and deal with things differently too, even in the normal day to day life let alone with cancer. I have  now found that it is easier to wait to be asked questions rather than to ask them as you then know they are ready to talk. On here I probably bore people to tears asking the same things but as a relative or carer it is so hard to know what to do and how to deal with every stage. Come and chat whenever you feel the need but take time too to have your own life as this also helps you cope on the difficult days. Take care Jules Hope you don't mind me talking to you. I am sorry to hear about your granddad. I know a little of what you are going through for I have lost an aunt, my grandmother and my mother all to breast cancer over the past few years. You comment that it's crazy that you find it easier to talk on here than it is to your family. I believe there are several reason for that Jody. No matter what age we are, we all try to make our family believe we are coping and we put on a brave face when the exact opposite is often true. Another reason is we try to protect our families as we know that they are already worried and we don't feel like adding to their worries by telling them how we feel. Plus I feel that we may feel sometimes that by opening up and talking to our family openly and honestly, some of them might think that we are weak as a result. But I do believe that in most cases our family are feeling the same feelings themself's, and if we were to talk to them about our worries and fears in an honest manor, It would help them too and not feel so alone. I am a great believer that a problem shared is a problem halved. I can well understand you feeling anger with the fact that your granddad didn't go to the doctor when he first felt unwell. As you get older, you will probably find we men can be very stubborn about going to see the doctor. We tend to bury our head in the sand and steadfastly refuse to accept there is anything wrong with us. I think it's just a macho thing. I was the same as your granddad and repeatedly refused to go to the doctor despite my wife telling me to. Finally her patience snapped and she told me she would drag me there if I didn't give in. And that's how they found out I had prostate cancer but luckily have since made a good recovery. If I had not listened to my wife at last, I could now well be in the position your granddad is. I do believe my wife saved my life by her actions that day and I can never fully repay her for that. But in the meantime anytime you are feeling low, please come back on here for there are lots of great people like Jules and I promise you,people on here will do all we can to help you. Sorry if I've rambled on a bit. Please take care and also let us know how you and your granddad are getting on. Best wishes to you and you family, regards Brian You havent rambled on at all, its nice to have people replying to me and making me feel less alone, im glad to hear about your recovery! I know its not his fault but part of me wishes id done more to make him go earlier and im full of anger that i dont know how to express. My grandad has gone in for an operation today to clear his food pipe which was being blocked by the tumour, so we are now waiting for news about how the op went if all goes well hopefully he will be able to eat again and put some weight back on. You are completley right with the way im feeling about talking to my family, its such a stressful time especially for my mum that i dont feel she will be able to cope if i tell her how i feel. Hope your grandad's op helps him to eat again. A worrying time for all the family but glad he is able to have treatment and my thoughts are with you. By the way when I get angry I write it all down and then throw it away. Don't know why but I find this helps to clear my mind an d then I concentrate on writing down good thoughts (and keep these in my diary) . I am sure my husband would think I had lost my marbles if hew knew what I was up to!!  Good luck to you all. Jules ",0,0
"Would you buy a used car that has been in an accident? Owner said that he is the 2nd owner. He bought the car at 35k (The car now has 50k miles) and that the original owner had been in an accident. He took it to a body shop and found that the bumper, fender and hood were replaced. I asked him if he had done any major work on it and he said that he had the right front axle replaced. He said everything else has been absolutely fine. He has been very straight forward and seems very honest. Just looking for opinions and stories... thanks in advance. I would never buy a used car without taking it to a mechanic (unless it was certified pre-owned) and pulling up the Carfax. The seller has already proven himself honest by disclosing the accident, so that's a plus. Get the carfax. Will give you more detail about the accident such as if it was driven away, towed from scene because it was inoperable, etc.. Sometimes there are even police reports and the name of the shop that did the repairs. What kind of car? If i were to buy one, I'd only do it if i was getting a great deal. Should not pay anywhere near blue book. Unless of course the accident in question involved a handicapped lady at Costo hitting a certain RCMB poster. If that's the case, buy the car and finish the job.

I would never buy a used car without taking it to a mechanic (unless it was certified pre-owned) and pulling up the Carfax. The seller has already proven himself honest by disclosing the accident, so that's a plus. True, but i wouldn't rely on him too much since he wasn't in the accident, the first owner was. ""People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care."" - Mark Dantonio. There is a good market of people buying vehicles that are deemed total losses by insurance companies, repairing them and re-selling. They used to be called one owner but laws were passed to stop that. You have no idea what parts were used in the repair. Did they come off other wrecks? Were all the front end parts like the steering linkage, struts ebven engine mounts replaced? Do you know what kind of accident? Better to be patient. Know what you want, cruise Craigslist and buy from a private owner who will let you take the vehicle to a body shop and a mechanic you trust before buying it. Also, if you do decide to go for it and everything regarding the body work, paint, frame, etc. checks out fine, just be aware when discussing price that a car at 50,000 miles is approaching the end of its life on quite a few items such as tires, brakes, suspension components, and whatnot. Also, it's right about the time for a transmission fluid and filter change (NOT FLUSH) and a coolant system service (especially on GM vehicles). Again, I'd stay away unless you're getting a good discount or you can verify who did the repair work. There are lots of low budget collision shops out there (Maaco and mom and pop stores) that don't do a very good job. They usually just put it back together so it runs and make it look pretty, but the stuff underneath is still not done right. Especially true with regard to the paint jobs they perform. If that's not done right, expect bubbling, corosion, etc. in the future at the site of repair. ""People don't care how much you know until they know how much you care."" - Mark Dantonio.

Also pulling the carfax would tell you if he is being straight about having had the car for the past 15k mileage wise. To the extent he has been, perhaps he is looking to dump it because it turns out the car has more problems then it is worth. I am extremely leary of buying a car from anyone who has owned it for a year or less absent a good/trustworthy explanation. Otherwise, I would be concerned you're just buying their headache. It is a 2007 Mercury Mariner Hybrid 4x4. It is blue booking somewhere between 16.5k. He said he knows he won't be able to get that based on it's history. He is asking 11k. I figured I can get it for around 10k. I am of course concerned about buying his headache. I asked him about why he is selling it and he said he has one too many cars and just bought a house and wanted to use the money towards that. I know that he did just buy a new house but who knows if the extra car reason is his reasoning. For sure I am going to be getting a carfax from him and then taking it to a mechanic. Do I go to a mechanic or a body shop? As for what it needs... I will find out about brakes when I take it in, but he told me the tires are going to need a replacement soon. I am taking it for a test drive tonight. From someone driving a car that was in a minor accident, no. Accidents f*** A LOT of shit up. A lot of minor things you don't notice early on that bite you in the long hall. Just about everything that holds fluid in my car leaks.. For sure I am going to be getting a carfax from him and then taking it to a mechanic. Do I go to a mechanic or a body shop? If you know a mechanic (as a friend or loyal customer) that would probably be best. I wouldn't take it to a body shop. And I've never had to bad experiences with mechanics, but I'm also very specific with what I want. ""Just change the timing belt, nothing else."" Just adding that because it's rumored mechanics have a tendency to see a problem with a lot on your car and charge you a small fortune. That's why I recommend using a mechanic you know, if possible. (not trying to treat you like an idiot, just not sure how much experience you have is all) CARFAX is definitely a good idea, even though it cost $35. I just bought a CARFAX for a truck and it told me that it was in an accident and how bad the accident was. I found out there was structural damage. It also told me that it was repaired multiple times after wards. It even told me that the airbags were deployed. There is a lot of detail in them, unless the vehicle was never taken to a shop. Its a Mercury. Its a dead brand, resale is crap. 4x4 means more parts that may have been damaged in the accident and not replaced. Then there's the hybrid thing. There is a boatload of electronics that have had at least one major impact and more modules and data collectors than you can count. You are forced to go to Ford because its a hybrid. You buy this vehicle and you are begging for down time and money flowing out of your wallet. This post has been edited 2 times, most recently by GRR Spartan on 12/6/2011 at 1:07 PM Its a Mercury.

Seemed like a good idea and a helluva deal but I really don't need another headache. I never thought about the electronic hybrid side of things. I am fairly good at fixing shit but once you throw electronics into the mix I am done for. It is a 2007 Mercury Mariner Hybrid 4x4. It is blue booking somewhere between 16.5k.

"Keyword : Mark As athletes make the transition from professional sports into the business sector , some find it helpful to rely on name recognition established in years past . It is the hope of those who represent these athletes-turned businessmen and women that the sports-related reputation carries sufficient weight in the corporate world to garner a significant amount of contract negotiating power . But even if our clients' reputations are strong now , who 's to say they will continue to be popular enough , good enough or even pure enough to maintain the interest of the consumers who are purchasing goods and services tied to the athletes' names ? This is where the concept of "" brand protection "" typically enters the discussion . Take a survey of a PR firm , an intellectual property attorney , sports agents and talent managers and you are bound to hear various definitions for the term "" brand protection , "" and even more explanations on the best methods of achieving it . In recent years it seems that business professionals have increasingly encouraged clients to achieve a certain level of brand protection by obtaining a formal trademark for their names , logos and even catchphrases . If , by doing so , the hope is to stave off would-be infringers and / or increase the chances of legally stripping infringers of profits generated from the unauthorized use of a protected mark , obtaining a trademark may or may not be the best vehicle to achieve these goals . A person can trademark a word , phrase , symbol or design that identifies and distinguishes the source of a good from goods associated with someone else . Although trademark holders have the exclusive right to use their registered marks , this federally recognized right may not provide the extensive level of legal protection we typically associate with "" trademarks . "" Intuitively , we believe people who sell goods – license plate holders , key chains , t-shirts , cups , etc. – bearing a swoosh symbol , distinctive bunny ears , or a black prancing stallion on a yellow shield , should be sued and forced to turn over their profits if it is the case that the sellers are not actually licensed by these multinational trademark holders . It also seems reasonable to think that the unauthorized sale of cloth patches bearing the initials of a national sports league , or figurines / dolls wearing a jersey bearing a popular player's number should also be deemed unlawful behavior . ( Note that this article will not discuss alternative legal bases a person may rely on to challenge this seemingly illegal behavior , independent of trademark laws . ) Surprisingly ( and for mark holders , unfortunately ) , in many parts of the United States , our intuition with regard to the protection afforded by trademark laws is wrong . In a federal case filed in Arizona , a district judge concluded that the unauthorized sale of license plate holders and key chains branded with a popular symbol for a German auto manufacturer did not constitute infringement . The trial judge explained that consumers are less concerned about who actually manufactures these license plate holders and key chains and more concerned with the functional use of the products that happen to include an aesthetically pleasing insignia . The function of the license plate holders and key chains outweighs the use of the German brand name . As a result , there is no trademark protection because trademark laws do not provide exclusive protections for functional goods . This decision was ultimately overturned on appeal ; however , weighing "" function "" against "" aesthetic "" charm continues to be a major consideration when a trademark holder sues an infringer . Reaching a different conclusion but relying on the same type of reasoning , a trial judge in Texas explained that since the function of an embroidered patch that is typically sewn on to one's own clothes is simply to display an association with a team or fan support as opposed to functioning in another manner ( like a t-shirt , for example ) , the National Hockey League could stop a manufacturer from making and selling these patches that was occurring without NHL permission . These examples show us that the rationale used by courts to enforce the scope of trademarks is neither settled nor necessarily intuitive to the general public because they are considering notions of "" aesthetic functionality . "" As a result , trademark holders should understand why they seek trademark protection , understand the function and aesthetic characteristics associated with the brand name , good and / or service , and cautiously set out to enforce rights as it may turn out to be an expensive and fruitless endeavor even when you know you 're right . Trademark Law Generally Trademark law is a species of "" unfair competition "" laws to the extent that trademark laws permit the holder of a mark to sue someone who is using a mark without permission . Trademark holders typically file lawsuits in an effort to limit consumer confusion . Theoretically , a trademark should garner confidence in consumers who tend to seek out certain products knowing they are officially endorsed by a specific mark holder . In this regard , trademark law can be relied on to protect reputation . When Mars Blackmon , a fictional character created by director Spike Lee , wondered aloud , "" Is it the shoes ? It 's got to be the shoes ... , "" sales of Nike's Air Jordan line probably increased exponentially because basketball fans believed , too , that maybe they could be better if they had the shoes . As a result , consumers specifically sought out Jordan's particular brand of shoes , confident in the manufacturer's product . In addition , trademarks prevent the misappropriation of goodwill by stopping others from stealing or capitalizing on the good reputation of the mark holder by passing off unauthorized goods or services as being endorsed by the athlete . By using a particular symbol on this line of shoes , the manufacturer and the athlete who lends his or her likeness confirm for consumers this product is of a particular quality that is unique from other brands . Trademarks encourage meaningful consumer participation in the market by asking the consumer to choose whether to buy a product associated with his or her favorite athlete or another , perhaps less popular brand . Lastly , trademarks encourage manufacturers to produce well-made products so that consumers are enticed to purchase more goods and services offered by the mark holder . So , with these goals , why and how are trademarks still limited in their legal effect and enforceability ? Limitation of protection based on aesthetic functionality In California , Arizona , Washington , New York , Connecticut and others , the scope of trademark protection is limited by a concept called "" aesthetic functionality . "" In the legal context , aesthetic functionality describes an attempt to classify some visually attractive ( or aesthetically pleasing ) design as "" functional "" and therefore free for all to copy and imitate . In considering the scope of protection trademarks afford , consider the following : Believing you are showing support for your favorite team , you go to your local sporting goods store to pick up a few things for the family . While there , you pick up a few hats , a couple shirts and some blankets to sit on . On each is plastered the name and logo for your team in various fonts and colors . Before heading to the cash register , do you demand from the sales associate a certificate of authenticity that each item bearing your team's logo was manufactured by an authorized licensee ? Probably not . After all , they are all being sold in a store and not on the street corner , right ? Although you hope that your choice has led to the purchase of products from someone who has permission to use the team's name and logo , it just might be that you bought an infringer's products – an infringer who lawfully sells product without permission from the registered mark holder . In February 2011 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit confirmed that the example above is the law of the land for this particular segment of the country [ 1 ] . In that case , the Court declined to recognize the existence of trademark infringement where a company sold Betty Boop dolls , t-shirts and handbags without the permission of the [ alleged ] trademark holder . The Court explained that because the products were "" functional "" and because there was no evidence that consumers were actually confused about the identity of the manufacturer , the commercial use of the Betty Boop character on these products could not be protected in the context of trademark law . This decision makes clear that courts recognize a strong public policy of promoting free competition . Courts are reluctant to award exclusive rights in a "" useful "" or functional product . What steps can trademark owners take to protect their marks from unauthorized use ? Predictable legal results are more likely to follow where a trademark is obtained by an athlete who wants to make sure cybersquatters ( for example ) can not capitalize from website domain names that lure unsuspecting people to a site by using the athlete's name or catchphrase for an unauthorized commercial gain . But , where the use of the trademark is grounded in a more complex set of facts , expectations as to enforceability should be shifted . Before running to trademark your name , logo or popular catchphrase , it is imperative that you know why you are doing it . In addition , try to get a clear understanding of the legal protections potentially afforded to you through ownership of the trademark . This means you need to find out why your business team ( PR , lawyer , management , etc. ) believes a trademark is necessary . Perhaps most important , use the trademark as a tool to develop your marketing or business plan , and consider the functional component attributable to your good ( s ) or service ( s ) that could potentially be used against you in an action for trademark infringement . Depending on your goals , a trademark should also be used to limit the scope of the number and type of consumer goods and services to which your mark is affiliated . This will help to create evidence of actual consumer confusion , should you find your trademark infringed .

"Peter Julian has seen the oil-and-gas industry from the 'shop floor' during his days as a labourer in a B.C. refinery. It's not a job or career he pursued, instead moving to social enterprises and eventually representing Burnaby-New Westminster as an NDP member of Parliament. Before being handed the portfolio of energy and natural resources shadow minister, Mr. Julian watched over treasury board, international trade and transportation. The varied experience, Mr. Julian says, allows him to appreciate the energy sector's impact on the wider economy. In a wide-ranging talk with FP energy editor Yadullah Hussain, the MP spells out the NDP's stance on the country's energy sector. Here are edited excerpts from the interview. Q The federal government believes oil sands is crucial to its economic strategy. Given your stance on the oil sands, what would be the key pillars of your energy strategy? A We have to get the policies right so we are looking at the overall contribution of the oil sands. We want to see prosperity for average families right around the country and allow us to transition to a green-energy economy because we need to go where our major competitors are going. One of the concerns I have is the emerging and growing green-energy gap between Canada and other industrialized countries. In 2011, in one quarter in the U.S. there were 600 patents for sustainable-energy innovation; in Canada we had 10. The overall green sustainable-energy sector is estimated to be about US$3-trillion by 2020 -- Canada gets far less than 1% of that. In terms of public sector, Canada's investment and research and development is the lowest among industrialized countries. We have been falling further behind, not just in green-energy development but in R&D generally. Coming out of Charlottetown [from the energy and mines ministers' meeting last week], we are seeing number of provinces taking initiatives -- Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Ontario -- and yet the federal government is simply not there. Q Renewable energy is crucial, but has its own issues. In the meantime, there are significant investments in hydrocarbons that can't be ignored. A US$3-trillion industry in green energy goes beyond infancy -- that's significant investment worldwide. If Canada is lagging on R&D, we are also missing a real opportunity in oil sands development . You have massive investments like Shell Canada with Quest , looking at carbon capture and storage.* And yet the federal government seems to completely reject the policy of cap-and-trade, which allows us to put a price on carbon . Shell Canada has been very clear with the Quest investment, which includes [investments from] the Alberta and federal governments. What we are seeing from the federal government is piecemeal development ... they are rejecting the possibility of putting in place a cap-and-trade system that allows the sustainability of new developments and installations like Quest. Q The industry is gearing up to produce around six million barrels per day in the next 20 years. Is the NDP against that development altogether or would you favour it if all the environmental conditions were met? A There are two issues. First is the environmental pact. Due diligence is simply not being done, particularly by the federal government in terms of enforcing existing regulation. The rapid pace of the oil and gas development is worrisome in part because sustainability has not been established. But here is the other issue: We need to ensure the resources we develop should have, as much as possible, value-added done in Canada . We are exporting raw bitumen, raw logs and raw minerals. The Conservative government's plan is to export more in raw state. This is a real problem because when you look at the disastrous trade deficits that we are seeing now in large part because we have a government that is focused on raw exports rather than the development of value-added products . We have lost half a million manufacturing jobs under the Conservatives' watch and they want to fuel raw exports rather than development of refinery capacity and upgrading capacity. When we are exporting raw bitumen, we are exporting jobs. We don't feel that the plan to carve out raw bitumen as fast as possible and ship it offshore is either environmentally sustainable or economically smart from a Canadian perspective. Putting aside the oil and gas sector, look at the mining, quarrying and smelting sectors. Over the last ten years, we have seen a decline in the number of jobs. We have seen a lot of new investments, but lower wages jobs have increased. Q Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney believes the high dollar is not to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs, which is the view of the NDP government... A We have seen a whole number of reports including studies from federal government that show the high dollar has played a contributory role to the collapse of our manufacturing industries. What's interesting in Mark Carney's speech in the accompanying notes, confirms what we have been saying.... The real income of the average Canadian family has eroded about 2% in the past year. Higher wages are being replaced by low paid jobs, which is a broader issue. Q But Canada has been held out as an economic model by most independent bodies. A When you look at the situation for the average Canadian family, it has not been the case for the last half-decade. Q How do you view the acquisition of Canadian resource assets by foreign state-owned companies such as CNOOC? A We are concerned with the growing foreign investment in Canada and what that might mean for the oil sands. We need a level playing field for these types of takeovers and ensure they take place if there is net benefit to Canada. The investors also need to know there is a process they will go through and clarity and transparency around the rules. For the CNOOC purchase, we are not seeing this from the government. They promised a couple of years ago a transparent process and a real definition of net benefit and have failed to do it. Q The NDP has also voiced concerns on Keystone XL, which would ship crude to our most important market. A That's part of our broader concern about the export of jobs . There are environmental considerations but economic considerations as well. We will be exporting thousands of jobs by sending bitumen that will be processed in the U.S. We have also raised concerns about Northern Gateway and when you look at the economic risk to Gateway, it has seen a reaction from the public because thousands of jobs are put at risk by Gateway, in tourism and fisheries. So we have opposed that as well . If the Conservatives attempt to ram through that pipeline with the changes that they have made to the NEB where ultimately, by cabinet, they can try to impose the pipeline on B.C., they risk not having a single safe seat in B.C. in the next federal election -- feelings are that high against the pipeline. Q Yet the NDP is in favour of transporting Western Canadian oil to Eastern Canada via pipelines, which is also the subject of environmental concern? A Tom Mulcair has spoken in principle about the importance of ensuring that our energy resources are developed in Canada and that we stop or reduce our dependence on foreign suppliers in Eastern Canada . It does not make a lot of sense that we are importing in Eastern Canada and as a result have risky supplies, often from the Middle East, and at the same time exporting raw bitumen. There needs to be a real attempt by working in partnership with communities and provinces. Q So in principle you like David Black's refinery proposal? # A What he proposed does not have a business plan and raised some questions more than anything else. He also wants to build components offshore, and that's self-defeating. That being said, we are happy that more people are looking at valued-added production in the country . We need to maximise the potential of our resources, and the fact that Mr. Black put forward that proposal shows more Canadians are coming to the NDP position . Footnotes by RA: * Peter Julian neglects to mention that 'carbon capture and storage' is an industry fop to deflect opposition to the tar sands. The idea is on the decline in the world because of questions about the danger of dumping large quantities of CO2 in permanent, underground storage ( David Suzuki calls it ""hiding our industrial waste"") and because companies will not invest in the expensive technology without large subsidies from government. While the Quest project appears to be proceeding, another CC&S tar sands project was abandoned earlier this year. # Last month, a businessman in BC with no oil industry experience, David Black, floated a proposal to build a multi-billion dollar tar sands refinery at Prince Rupert, on the north coast of British Columbia. The proposal was dismissed by industry observers as economically unviable considering existing, excess capacity at oil refineries in North America. Peter Julian and the NDP seem to believe that the overwhelming opposition to the Northern Gateway tar sands pipeline (to Kitimat) and the growing opposition to expansion of Trans Mountain pipeline (to Vancouver) would melt away in the interest f oil refinery ""jobs"" in Prince Rupert.

"With customizable management features , it is used to create private websites with online courses for educators and trainers to achieve learning goals . Moodle ( acronym for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment ) allows for extending and tailoring learning environments using community sourced plugins . Moodle was originally developed by Martin Dougiamas to help educators create online courses with a focus on interaction and collaborative construction of content , and it is in continual evolution . The first version of Moodle was released on 20 August 2002 . Nowadays the Moodle Project is led and coordinated by Moodle HQ , an Australian company of 30 developers which is financially supported by a network of eighty four Moodle Partner service companies worldwide . Moodle's development has also been assisted by the work of open-source programmers . Moodle as a learning platform can enhance existing learning environments . As an E-learning tool , Moodle has a wide range of standard and innovative features such as calendar and Gradebook . Moodle is a leading virtual learning environment and can be used in many types of environments such as education , training and development and in business settings . Plugins are a flexible tool set , allowing Moodle users to extend the features of the site . There are hundreds of plugins for Moodle , extending the features of Moodle's core functionality . Each plugin is maintained in the Moodle plugins directory . As of April 2015 , there are over 1,000 plugins available for Moodle with over 7 million downloads . Graphical themes for Moodle can be installed to change the look and functionality of a Moodle site or of an individual course . Moodle has been translated in over 100 languages , available for any site administrator to install . People in various countries maintain and contribute to the various language packs . Moodle has adopted the following e-learning standards : Sharable Content Object Reference Model ( SCORM ) is a collection of elearning standards and specifications that define communications between client side content and a server side learning management system , as well as how externally authored content should be packaged in order to integrate with the LMS effectively . There are two versions : SCORM 1.2 and SCORM 2004 . Moodle is SCORM 1.2 compliant , and passes all the tests in the ADL Conformance test suite 1.2.7 for SCORM 1.2 . SCORM 2004 is not supported in Moodle , however Rustici Software have a Moodle plugin which can turn any Moodle site into a fully compliant SCORM 2004 LMS . The AICC HACP standard for CMI was developed by the Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee ( AICC ) and is used to call externally authored content and assessment packages . AICC content packages are supported in Moodle 2.1 and later versions . IMS Content Packages can also be imported into Moodle . In addition , Moodle Book activities can be exported as IMS Content Packages . Learning Tools Interoperability ( LTI ) is a standard way of integrating rich learning applications ( often remotely hosted and provided through third-party services ) with educational platforms . Moodle uses the External Tool activity to act as an ' LTI consumer ' as standard , and will act as an ' LTI provider ' using a plugin . Users can download and install Moodle on a Web server , such as Apache HTTP Server , and a number of database management systems , such as PostgreSQL , are supported . Pre-built combinations of Moodle with a Web server and database are available for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh . Other automated installation approaches exist , such as installing a Debian package , deploying a ready-to-use TurnKey Moodle appliance , using the Bitnami installer , or using a "" one-click install "" service such as Installatron . Certified Moodle Partners provide other Moodle services , including hosting , training , customization and content development . This network of providers support development of the Moodle project through royalties . Moodle runs without modification on Unix , Linux , FreeBSD , Windows , OS X , NetWare and any other systems that support PHP and a database , including webhost providers . Moodle also has import features for use with other specific systems , such as importing quizzes or entire courses from Blackboard or WebCT . As of February 2010 , Moodle will not import Blackboard courses , apparently due to changes in php code-releases . In March 2012 Blackboard acquired two companies based on Moodle's software including Baltimore-based Moodlerooms Inc. and NetSpot of Adelaide , Australia . In August 2015 , Blackboard acquired Colombia-based Nivel7 , possibly the largest Moodle services provider in Latin America . The Red Hat site , Opensource.com , reports that Moodle will always be an open source project , with clear delineation between Blackboard and Moodle . For many schools , colleges and universities , SIMS integration is key to ensure a seamless data flow from the Management Information System through to the Learning Platform and back again . Many Learning Platforms do not enable write-back functionality , however this is often a key requirement from schools needing to write data onto their MIS and back again . Martin Dougiamas , who has graduate degrees in computer science and education , wrote the first version of Moodle . Dougiamas started a Ph.D. to examine "" the use of open source software to support a social constructionist epistemology of teaching and learning within Internet-based communities of reflective inquiry . "" Although how exactly social constructionism makes Moodle different from other eLearning platforms is difficult to show , it has been cited as an important factor by Moodle adopters . Other Moodle adopters , such as the Open University in the UK , have pointed out that Learning Management Systems can equally be seen as "" relatively pedagogy-neutral "" . The stated philosophy of Moodle includes a constructivist and social constructionist approach to education , emphasizing that learners ( and not just teachers ) can contribute to the educational experience . Using these pedagogical principles , Moodle provides an environment for learning communities . The acronym Moodle stands for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment . ( In the early years the "" m "" stood for "" Martin's "" , named after Martin Dougiamas , the original developer ) . As well as being an acronym , the name was chosen because of the dictionary definition of Moodle and to correspond to an available domain name . Moodle has continued to evolve since 1999 ( since 2001 with the current architecture ) . It has been translated into over 100 different languages and is accessible in many countries worldwide . Institutions can add as many Moodle servers as needed without having to pay license fees . The Open University of the UK currently uses a Moodle installation for their 200,000 users while the UK government uses a Moodle installation for their Civil Service Learning platform serving half a million employees . Grading improvements , auto-login , sign-up improvements and SSO , new notification preferences A MoodleMoot is a conference for Moodle community members , held to learn about Moodle , share experiences of the learning platform , discuss research in related educational technologies and contribute ideas to future Moodle development . Held around the world , MoodleMoots are organised by universities or other large organisations using Moodle , Moodle Partners , Moodle associations or Moodle HQ . In the higher education market in the United States as of fall 2013 , Moodle is the second largest provider with 23 % market share , following Blackboard ( 41 % ) , with Desire2Learn ( 11 % ) and Instructure as number three and four providers .",1,7

"One Dance Too Many The night I first met Ziegler he was wearing a ridiculous wig. Not only was it too big for him, but it was also on back to front. I hope he hasn't got his underpants on back to front, too, I thought. It was about two o'clock in the morning and Ziegler was standing at the bar in the Banana, a live house in West Berlin, drinking a glass of wine and bobbing from side to side to the jerky rhythm of the reggae band on stage. A tense-looking girl in a red beret held his hand and looked around nervously, as if she were expecting a police raid. They were an odd pair, out of place, even in the laid back Banana, and that interested me. ""I like your tie,"" I said, tongue in cheek, to the old man as I approached him. ""Do you?"" he said, and his eyes started sparkling. ""Gisela Ulbricht gave it to me in 1938, just before she left for America. She was a wonderful woman, Jewish, and rather liberal with her favours, but everyone loved her. No pun intended."" He lifted the tie very close to his face and peered at it like someone trying to read the hallmark on the inside of a ring. ""Ziegler,"" he said suddenly, offering me his hand. ""Artist and poet. Charmed to meet you. It is a long time since I have been out so late, but I'm enjoying myself immensely."" I turned to the girl and was about to introduce myself, but she cut me off. ""Wilhelm and I were having such an interesting conversation before you interrupted us."" I could feel her hostility and had no wish to argue with her; so I wished the old man a pleasant evening and left them standing at the bar. Back at my table I soon forgot about the two odd characters as I got involved in an argument with a Scotsman about the origin of the bagpipes. I was just bracing myself to smack him on the nose when someone rapped on our table. We all looked up. ""It would have been nice talking to you,"" said Ziegler. ""See you here tomorrow."" Then he turned and walked out. The next day I was sitting at a table on the sidewalk when Ziegler approached. I would not have recognized him if he had not been with the girl for he was not wearing his wig, and he was completely bald. This time the girl was wearing a black beret. I called out to him as he got to the door and he tuned and peered in my direction, but apparently couldn't see me until I got up and started walking towards him. ""I didn't see you,"" he said. ""It's my glasses. They are too old."" We went inside and sat down at my regular table. The usual people were there, including the Scotsman with whom I had argued the previous day. This time he was still sober. ""This is only the second time I've been out so late in the past twenty years,"" said Ziegler . ""Yesterday was Bettina's birthday, and I promised to take her to dinner. On the way back we passed this place and it looked so jolly that I just felt drawn inside. I thought it might give me some inspiration for a painting."" ""Is that what you do?"" asked the Scotsman. ""Are you a painter?"" ""It's one of the things I do,"" answered Ziegler. ""What do you do?"" ""Me? ?'m a musician."" Ziegler suddenly burst into song. Then he jumped up and began to dance around the table, singing wildly out of tune. Somebody turned the music off and everybody in the place stood gaping at the old man as if he were stark naked. Almost as quickly as he had started, he stopped, did a flurry of steps in imitation of a tap dance, bowed and sat down. The Banana exploded with applause and Ziegler's smile lit up the whole room. ""A glass of wine for Caruso,"" screamed the Scotsman as he stood up to shake hands with Ziegler, who then went on to entertain us for the next few hours with impersonations of famous people we had never heard of. He had a way of putting the unfamiliar to us so that we felt as if we had grown up with them. ""How about Alfred Hartmut, then?"" He began to mutter in a voice that was so deep none of us could catch a word. Nevertheless, we were in stitches. All the while he entertained us, he sipped away at his wine until he finally slid forward and passed out. When he came to, I was on the stage with my band. We had just started a Joabim number when I noticed Ziegler , supported by the girl, staggering forward to get a better look. As he peered in my direction without actually seeing me, I realized just how bad his eyesight was. ""How long have you had those glasses?"" I asked after the set was finished. ""Quite some time, but it's not just the glasses that are the problem, it's the light. I need a nice bright light before I can see clearly. That's the trouble with my flat at the moment, the light is not very good. I can hardly see to work."" It must have been the wine, but without thinking too deeply of the implications, ?volunteered to take a look at his lighting the next day. The next day I got up with a vicious hangover just around noon. I guzzled about a litre of water, dressed and then staggered round to the address Ziegler had given me before he had left the Banana. Fortunately it was only five minutes away from where I was living at the time. His flat was in an elegant-looking old building that had survived two world wars and a ferocious assault on the city by Russian infantry in the last stages of the second one. Yet it had not lost any of its dignity. I was pleased that Ziegler lived on the ground floor because l did not feel up to climbing any stairs. Charmed by the facade of the building, I was unprepared for the surprise that awaited me. It was a few minutes after I rang the doorbell before I heard Ziegler bumpling his way along the corridor. As the door opened, I sobered up. The most unpleasant smell that I had ever come across burst through the door and nearly choked me. It was as if I had just stuck my head into an eighteenth century thunder-box. ""Welcome to my humble abode,"" said Ziegler with a smile that l would not have risked in such an atmosphere. ""I've lived here since nineteen hundred and six."" He stepped aside for me to enter then, almost coyly, continued, ""It's a bit cluttered up, but I'm sure that you can squeeze in."" I was nauseated but I had promised him that I would fix up his lighting so that he would be able to paint again. I figured that if l were to breathe through my mouth only, it would not be so bad, so I entered cautiously. ""Since nineteen hundred and six,"" he repeated. ""The Kaiser was still on the throne in those days."" A quick calculation and I realized he was talking of seventy-two years. ""Were you born here?"" I asked, testing the accuracy of his memory. ""No"", he replied, ""I moved here when I was five years old."" ""You must be seventy-seven years old,"" I said. ""Seventy-six,"" he said curtly, ""my birthday's in December."" ""Well where's your studio?"" I asked. ""It's at the end of the corridor. You'll have to be careful, there are quite a few things on the floor."" He was not joking. As I struggled down the corridor, climbing over old furniture, stepping on piles of ancient newspapers and magazines, some of them over fifty years old, and squeezing past pictures piled up to the ceiling, I could hardly comprehend that I was in the domicile of a fellow human being. It was more like being in a dilapidated warehouse. By the time I got to the end of the corridor, I should have been prepared for anything. But his studio was not just anything. As I stood in the doorway to survey the mess, I saw that it was a repository for every kind of junk imaginable; and it also seemed to double as his bedroom. And it had a broader range of unpleasant aromas than I had ever come across anywhere in the world. Although I did not smoke, as soon as l spotted the packet of Gauloises lying, almost as if they had been deliberately placed, at my feet, I picked them up and asked him for a light. The old man looked at me as if I had just asked him for a kiss. ""I thought you didn't smoke!"" ""I've just started,"" I replied. ""Well, I don't know if I've got any matches,"" he said. ""I don't smoke, either. But if you can find any matches in there,"" he gestured into the studio, ""you're welcome to them."" Suddenly I lost the desire to smoke and I dropped the cigarettes where I had found them. Getting into the studio was more difficult than I had imagined. First of all, I had to step over a bucket of what seemed to be urine. I stood on a plate, breaking it as I did so, and I lifted my foot so quickly that I nearly knocked the bucket over. The old man peered at me curiously and asked if I could see all right. I told him that it was a little dark and that some more light would be helpful. He produced a small flashlight and handed it to me. ""If you can get into the corner,"" he said, ""there is a socket. You can plug in the lamps then you'll have enough light. It took me almost fifteen minutes to negotiate the five or six metres across the studio. There I found a host of cables and extension plugs, so I tried to figure out which one to plug in. I made the right guess for, as soon as I plugged it in, the whole room lit up. I had never seen a room so bright and at the same time so dark. Ziegler apparently enjoyed my surprise for he bellowed in mock Biblical oratory, ""Let there be light!"" The light actually accentuated the clutter. The room was much bigger than I had expected. It was about thirty-six square metres, and the ceiling was very high. Nevertheless, there was almost no space at all, neither horizontally nor vertically. ""Now, where is the cable you wanted me to fix?"" I asked him. ""It's under my desk,"" he said. ""To your right,"" I turned around but couldn't figure out where it was until he pointed at a piece of furniture completely buried under a mountain of newspapers and magazines, many of which, I noticed, were erotic. To get underneath the desk, I had to drag out a very heavy wooden tea chest that he told me contained interesting stones which he had collected when he was a little boy. ""I started collecting stones when I lived briefly with my grandmother in Weimar Strasse,"" he said, ""that's in the East now."" ""That's a long time to pursue a hobby,"" I said. ""You must have been collecting stones for over seventy years now."" ""Oh, no, I stopped collecting stones when l was eight years old. That's when I started collecting tin cans."" I had no answer to that, so I took off my glasses and wiped the dust from my eyes, then I climbed into the space where the tea chest had been. The cable was worn through and obviously dangerous. I asked him to turn the electricity off. I heard him climbing out of the living room and clattering along the corridor. The air under the desk was repulsive; it was even worse that the stench above it. I wanted to get the cable fixed as quickly as possible so that I could get out into the fresh air, so I called out for him to hurry up. It went suddenly dark. ""Is that OK?"" he yelled. I groped around and found the cable but I couldn't see to work on it. ""No,"" I answered. ""I can't see a thing. Turn the electricity back on"" There was a flash. A fierce pain seared up my am and smashed me in the chest. My head almost split open as it crashed into the underside of the desk. Then everything went black. I opened my eyes tentatively and saw a dim, blurred light waving in front of my face. I had the impression that somebody was trying to talk to me but I couldn't hear anything. In fact, my first perception was of a wet coldness, as if I were floating in water. Then there was the foul smell. Gradually my hearing started to come back. ""You've knocked the bucket over,"" I heard him say. ""You're all wet. Shall I get you a towel?"" I shook my head. ""Just help me to get up."" He took my arm and started pulling, but he could only raise me to my knees before dropping me into the pool of urine again. ""It's OK,"" I said. ""You Just hold the torch so that we can find our way out and I'll get up myself,"" I said. Then I concentrated all my strength and managed to get to my feet. I was shaking badly but at least I could move. ""You'd better dry yourself,"" he said, ""you'll catch cold if you go out like that."" But catching a cold was the least thing l was worried about. I wanted to get out of the stinking clothes and take a shower before I went down with something serious. ""Where's your bathroom?"" I asked him. ""It's at the end of that corridor over there,"" he said, ""but it's full up. You won't be able to get in."" ""Where do you wash and bathe?"" I asked him. He looked surprised at my question. ""In the kitchen."" I had not noticed the other corridor when l had come in and l had trouble locating it in the dark. Ziegler pointed his feeble flashlight in the general direction but it did not help much, so I gave up and told him that I would get washed and changed at home. We set off to walk the short distance to my place. On the first comer, three old ladies and a poodle jumped out of my way in disgust. The poodle snarled at me and one of the old ladies made a disparaging remark about hippies, sewers, and disinfection. Ziegler looked hurt. I think he thought that the old ladies were talking about him. But worse was to come. We had almost reached my apartment when an Irishman, who played the bodran in a folk group, hailed me from the other side of the road. He darted across between the traffic, skidded to a halt in front of me. ""Christ!"" he said, ""Where did you get your aftershave? From a cesspool?"" He tuned and ran away laughing, and l knew that before long just about everybody l knew would also be laughing. When I walked into the Banana that evening the Irishman was already there. He looked up, pinched his nose and rushed past me and out the door. It was well rehearsed, and the rest of our crowd rewarded his performance with an outburst of raucous laughter. ""I hear you've been swimming in insalubrious waters,"" said the Scotsman. "" No, Jimmy,"" I said. ""I had haggis for lunch and it didn't agree with me."" ""From what I heard,"" the Scotsman continued, ""even the dogs couldn't stand it."" There was no way I could talk my way out of it, so I didn't even try. Instead, I described the state of Ziegler 's apartment, and said that I intended to help him out by cleaning it up. ""Any volunteers?"" I looked the Scotsman straight in the eye. ""Will you get me a gas mask?"" he laughed. ""Yes,"" I said. ""When do we start, then?"" Before long there were about a dozen volunteers, and we decided to start the following day at noon. The Cafe Bleibtreu was packed when I arrived there for breakfast, just after eleven o'clock. The Irishman was the only one drinking beer: the others were on coffee. ""I should be on the schnapps,"" he said, ""if the place smells is as bad as you did yesterday."" I was surprised but very pleased with the turnout. My fellow musicians had been accused of being shallow and selfish. They were nocturnal -- most of them never went to bed before sunrise -- yet here they were, way past their bedtime, ready to help an old man they had only known for a few days. . ""Where's the gas mask?"" shouted the Scotsman. ""He's drinking one,"" I replied, pointing at the Irishman. ""I'll have two,"" was his response. The breakfast seemed to go on for ages. Nevertheless, shortly after noon we made our way to Ziegler place. He was astonished when he opened the door and saw the crowd behind me. ""What are you here for?"" he asked, ""I wasn't expecting you."" ""Don't worry, even if you were expecting us, you wouldn't have been able to clean up before we got here."" The smell crept out from behind him. I felt as if were about to throw up everything I had eaten over the previous five days. But I stifled my feelings and cheerfully said, ""We've come to clean up!"" Ziegler 's brows furrowed, ""To clean up?"" ""Yes,"" I said. ""We are going to bring some clean air into your life."" ""What should I do in the meantime? ""Go to Bettina's. place,"" I answered. Thirty minutes later, after I had had a bitter telephone exchange with the girl in the beret, Ziegler left for her place. The first thing we did after he had left was to prise open all of the windows -- and that was no easy task. Then we set about cleaning the place up. Carmine, who sang in a bossa nova group, organized the cleaning. She had arranged for a stack of cardboard boxes and large plastic bags, and she supervised us while we filled them. The things worth saving went in the boxes, and the junk was put in the bags. Around six o'clock, although we were no where near finished, Ziegler returned. He was with the girl in the beret. She looked as if she wanted to rip my heart out. ""What do you think you are doing?"" she screamed at me when she saw the boxes. ""You have no right to touch these things. Some of them are valuable."" ""We are just trying to help a friend get himself sorted out,"" I said. ""You're no friend of his."" She almost spat at me. ""You've only known him for a few days."" ""Friendship knows no bounds of time,"" I said. ""so why don't you either beat it or take off that stupid beret and give us a hand! We need another duster. God knows there's enough dust here for all of us."" The Scotsman had apparently found a bottle of something while he had been cleaning and, rather than throw it out, he had drunk it. It must have been strong stuff for he staggered up to where the argument was taking place and pointed his finger at the girl. ""What's it got to do with you money grabber? How long have you been friends with him? Not long, I bet! Just waiting for him to croak, are you."" It was Ziegler who calmed things down. He had been standing there taking it all in. Suddenly he started to sing a drinking song about the value of friendship. Within minutes everybody joined in, even the girl in the beret. When the singing stopped, even she was smiling. Ziegler strode from room to room, astonished that he could actually walk around without standing on or falling over something. He even sang as he went. When he entered the study he stopped singing and glanced nervously to where the erotic magazines had been. ""By the way,"" said the Scotsman, ""I found some magazines other there. They must have been left by the previous tenant. It's a wonder you didn't find them and throw them out. They were filthy."" Ziegler winced. ""I put them in a box out back. You might want to get rid of them when you have a minute."" Ziegler's smile appeared again. ""It's wonderful. It hasn't been this clean since my mother passed away. Let's have a party."" We were ready to drop our dusters and start drinking immediately, but Carmine stepped forward and put her foot down. It would take another two days to finish the cleaning. After that we could have the party, she told us. And we all knew that she was talking sense, so nobody argued. It was actually four days later that we had the party. The flat was sparkling. Every nook and cranny had been disinfected, scrubbed and polished. The spacious rooms had been tastefully decorated under the supervision of Carmine and the girl in the beret, who claimed to be an art historian. The smell of flowers had replaced the dankness that had existed there for so long. And the freshly painted white walls highlighted the brightness that had been missing. I was stunned by the number of people who tuned up for the party. Word of mouth travels fast in musicians' circles. Friends that Ziegler had never heard of turned up to celebrate the cleaning of his flat. By eight o'clock there must have been more than fifty people there. A stereo with huge speakers had been set up in the living-room and on the improvised dance floor people gyrated and twisted to the sound of Bob Marley. There was so much smoke that it was difficult to breathe, so I went outside for some air. There were people sitting all around the step at entrance to the building, and most of them held either glasses or bottles. They, too, had surfaced for air. On the wall around a flower bed, a good way from the others, sat a solitary figure. It was the girl in the beret. She had a wineglass in one hand and a cigarette in the other. She looked incredibly depressed. ""Mind if sit here,"" I asked as I sat down next to her. ""You've ruined my relationship with Wilhelm,"" she said without emotion. ""Wilhelm? I don't know who you're talking about,"" I said. ""Who do you think he is?"" she snarled at me, pointing in the direction of Ziegler's flat. ""He's my only friend."" ""He's just acquired about a fifty other friends tonight,"" I said, ""and if you've got any sense, you'll capitalize on it. If he's your friend, then they'll be your friends as well. Come on inside. Let's dance."" She followed me inside. The air was heavy. The music reverberated through every room. The pulse was hypnotic. The living room was as tightly packed as when I had left. I could see almost nothing through the smoke. Then a strobe flashed across Ziegler's bald pate. In the second that he was highlighted, I saw the ecstasy in his smile. I grabbed the girl in the beret and pushed my way through the crowd. We started dancing our way across the floor to Ziegler. When he saw the girl in the beret he reached across and touched her hand. That was the first time I had seen her really smile. Carmine, who was dancing with Ziegler , looked at me and shook her head. ""I'm beat. I can't go on."" She took Ziegler by the am and led him out of the room. We followed. In the kitchen, Carmine poured herself a drink, looked at Ziegler and said ""You've worn me out."" Ziegler 's eyes grew even brighter and he bowed. ""Do you know that you are the first woman who has said that to me for almost thirty years."" Then he turned to the woman in the beret and said ""Do you want to be the second?"" Without waiting for an answer, he grabbed her hand and dragged her back to the living-room. It was hard to believe that a man of his age could have so much energy. But there he was, almost eighty years old and dancing like a man in his twenties. I stood in the doorway drinking a beer, looking on in amazement. Ziegler bobbed up and down, backwards and forwards and from side to side. And the girl in the beret was smiling. I was on my way to the kitchen to get another beer when l bumped into the Scotsman in the corridor. He, too, had been impressed with Ziegler's stamina, and expressed himself in a sexual simile, as was his usual turn of speech. But I didn't get my beer. There was a horrific scream followed by a crash in the living room. I ran back in. Everyone was in a state of panic. Ziegler lay on the floor gasping for breath. ""Call and ambulance,"" I shouted as I forced my way through the crowd to Ziegler . He looked at me and a faint smile spread across his face. ""That was just one dance too many!"" he said. Then he let out one last rasping breath. ",8,8
"Griffin wrote and recorded ""Top of the World"" for her would-be 2000 album Silver Bell . [ 1 ] But a dispute with her label A&M Records caused the album to go unreleased and Griffin to be dropped, [ 1 ] although copies of Silver Bell circulated and increased Griffin's reputation as a songwriter within the music industry. [ 2 ] The Dixie Chicks, who had already treated other Griffin songs and had toured with Griffin on their 2000 Fly Tour , [ 3 ] recorded ""Top of the World"" as the concluding track on their 2002 album Home . Beginning quietly with Home' s mixture of acoustic stringed instruments, and with the vocal line shifting around among one-, two-, and three-part singing, the song begins by portraying an almost unbearable level of regret [ 4 ] [ 5 ] at things not done: [ 6 ] [ 7 ] I wished I was smarter, I wished I was stronger. I wished I loved Jesus The way my wife does ... I wish it had been easier Tension is built up with pauses, then midway through a string section begins accompanying in an ominous fashion. The reason for the regret is fully unveiled: [ 4 ] [ 6 ] I come home in the evening, Sit in my chair. One night they called me for supper But I never got up — I stayed right there, in my chair. The strings then pick up in intensity during the instrumental coda , as Chicks lead singer Natalie Maines moans wordlessly and then repeats ""To the top of the world"" as a mantra over and over. Dixie Chick Emily Robison said of ""Top of the World"" that it was ""biggest departure on the album, but I'm so glad that we did it because I think it shows a whole other dimension."" [ 7 ] During their 2002 concert film An Evening with the Dixie Chicks , Maines attempted to explain the song's startingly unusual perspective: It is written from the point of view of a man who has passed on, and he's sort of looking down wishing that he had been a different person, and having a lot of regrets and wishing he hadn't had the negative effect on the people in his life and err... I don't know what I just said... Author Chris Willman wrote that this was ""a song that could send a chill down even a seasoned spine after repeat listens."" [ 4 ] Entertainment Weekly stated that the Dixie Chicks' recording ""lift[ed] the quality of [the song] in a way [its] author herself could not."" [ 8 ] The New York Times said that ""Top of the World"" was an example of the Dixie Chicks turning to Griffin for their most ambitious material [ 6 ] that at the same time led to the Chicks' commercial and critical success. [ 9 ] ""Top of the World"" was released as a single in mid-2003, [ 5 ] together with a music video , [ 5 ] [ 7 ] but failed to chart. At six minutes the song was likely too long for radio, but by now the infamous controversy regarding Maines' criticism of U.S. President George W. Bush had broken out, [ 5 ] and the Chicks had become a country radio anathema. [ 5 ] Maines would remark of the video, ""We haven't been banned from television yet."" [ 5 ] Directed by Sophie Muller [ 10 ] and filmed in London , [ 7 ] it portrayed the three Chicks as three women in different stages of the protagonist's life. [ 7 ] The story started with a boy growing up with his single mother (Emily Robison), who frequently abused and neglected him. As a result, he would become frustrated with his life and in turn mutilate inanimate objects such as a rag doll. Later, the boy grows up as a bitter person and never grows close to his daughter and wife (Martie Maguire). When he became old, and his daughter (Natalie Maines) grows up, she loves and takes care of him like her mother did when she was little. The old man dies feeling regretful about his life, but the cycle is broken when Natalie raises a good family in her generation and loves her family. It was premiered on VH1 on September 22, 2003, [ 11 ] and it would later be nominated for MVPA Awards in the Adult Contemporary Video and Director of the Year categories. [ 10 ] Griffin's own re-recording of ""Top of the World"" would finally surface for good on her 2004 album Impossible Dream . [ 1 ] As the Dixie Chicks' version had been close in arrangement to Griffin's original, [ 3 ] [ 13 ] Griffin re-arranged it this time around. [ 3 ] It featured the violin of Lisa Germano , and Allmusic described the recording's ""quietly intense relationship meditation"" as reaching an ""aching climax"". [ 14 ] The Washington Post wrote that Griffin's recording would have ""flooded the country airwaves"" were it not for ""music business realities"". [ 15 ] ",1,1
"Animal Collective is an art-pop band from Baltimore, Md., but these days they also call Los Angeles and Portugal home. Since 2000, they've made nine albums, six EPs, and one very freaky movie (or ""visual album""), ODDSAC .  Their tenth album, Centipede Hz , comes out on September 4. Animal Collective consists of four members, all of whom are friends from high school (some from much earlier) and all of whom have fake names that represent things that they're not in real life. We talked to each of them individually and this is the third of out four conversations. Noah Lennox is one of the founding members of Animal Collective. He also goes by the moniker Panda Bear. He gave himself the name because he liked drawing pictures of panda bears as a kid. Yes, that is the real reason. He's 34 years old and plays many instruments, including synthesizers and (occasionally) drums. Panda Bear is the one member of Animal Collective who, based entirely on first impressions, would be the most fun to have a beer with. No offense to the other Animal Collective guys, but you have the best pseudonym. Thank you. I'm a big fan of the name. And the animal. As awesome as it is, do you ever feel trapped by it? Trapped? A professional pseudonym is like a tattoo. Once you have it, it's difficult to get rid of. Are there some days when you don't feel like being Panda Bear? Oh, yeah. I get really intense about naming things. And really finicky. I'm always changing my mind, always wanting to change them. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a time when I thought about changing my name. To what? I don't know. Probably just my normal name. But I'm a realist. At this point I've stuck with Panda Bear long enough that it's not going away. Which is fine. I'm okay with it. We haven't heard you drum on an Animal Collective album for awhile. It's been eight years. But you're back behind the drum kit for Centipede Hz . Was that intentional, or was everybody else in the band like, ""Screw that, I'm not drumming, you do it?"" It was more about the nature of the music. For the last group of songs we did, we would play shows and not really work up a sweat. There wasn't a whole lot of physicality to it. It was all about working with longer samples of repetitive phrases and just manipulating those sounds with a mixer and things like that. It had a sort of intensity, but there wasn't much of an interaction on an instrument level. But now you're back to kicking out the jams? Yeah, we all wanted to do something where we brought that side of music to the forefront again. For me, doing something on the drums is like a jump start to doing something really active. Settle a bet between me and my MTV Hive editor. If there was a drumming competition between you and Richard Parry, the ginger sometimes drummer in Arcade Fire, who would win? I don't really think of myself as a very accomplished drummer. I'm mostly interested in the musical side of drums. I like the sounds and tonalities of things. I'm not technically a very good drummer. So yeah, he'd probably blow me out of the water. My son responds strongly to music. My daughter not so much. She's more of a visual person. She draws all the time. I actually used to draw a lot when I was young too. She doesn't like music at all? No, no, she likes music. But she only responds to specific types of music. Usually heavy rhythm stuff, like Beyonc or Rihanna. She's really down with any kind of music with a rapid-fire energy. She's kind of a fire cracker that way. Anything languid doesn't really do it for her. So she's not a big Bon Iver fan? No, that's not her thing. But my son, his ears perk up at pretty much anything. Any kind of sound at all, he's interested in it. If your son started a band, which Animal Collective song would they cover? Wow, that's a great question. He's a pretty progressive little guy, so probably something off the Danse Manatee album. He could pull that off pretty well, I think. He likes to break things. And punch things and kick things. That's what he's really into. I remember playing some shows where something would break after the first three minutes of the set. And we would just totally improvise the rest of the show because we couldn't play what we planned to play anymore. Something like that, my son would really knock that out of the park. There have been various Animal Collective solo albums over the years. You've done four. Avey's done one and is talking about a second. Deakin's got a solo record coming out soon. Are your intentions similar to why the guys in KISS put out solo albums in the late '70s? Um, I don't know. What were their intentions? From what I understand, Ace wanted to quit the band and go solo because Gene and Paul were being dicks. But Gene was like, ""Dude, chill, we've got a good thing going here."" So they all agreed to make solo albums rather than break up the band. It was just a band time out. Yeah, it definitely feels like that. Not that we need a time out. I mean, first of all, to me, everything I work on solo, it all feels like a band thing. One thing informs the other, and it all feels part of the same creative trajectory. But you give each other space. Exactly, yeah. Even though we have band stuff, we also like to work on our own. We're excited to leave space for each other to be able to do those things. But doing the solo stuff, it never felt like there was any sort of serious danger that it would fracture the band. You'll always get the guys back together eventually and make your Dynasty disco record. Well, maybe not exactly that. [ Laughs .] From Strawberry Jam to the new album, the one adjective that keeps getting used when describing your music is ""alien."" As in, extraterritorial. Is that an accident, or is that your target demographic? When we were working on the new record, we had this image of an alien band. It sounds silly, but we were always like ""Let's get into that alien band place."" Meaning, you played like aliens? Yeah. Like we're these aliens that are hearing snippets of radio frequencies coming out from the earth, maybe never getting a full song. It's just pieces of different music from all over the globe. Maybe they never get a full song. It's just notes and short flashes of melodies. And then we create our own musical landscapes based on that. We were always pushing to get the songs to that foreign place. ""I would guess that alien music is something that I can't even imagine. I would love to be able to say, ""Oh yeah, alien music sounds just like our album."" But I'm pretty sure it doesn't."" So on this record, you're playing as an alien? More or less, yeah. What's the alien version of you look like? Huh. I never thought about it that way. Does he have gills? Is he mostly amoeba? What type of life form are you? There's a weird kind of blue keyboard player in the cantina band in Star Wars . I always thought that guy was super cool. Are you sure it sounds like Centipede Hz ? Maybe it's not all trippy and spacey. Maybe they're like, ""We're really into acoustic singer-songwriters."" Maybe ""spacey"" music is like their hair metal. They could be like ""Oh man, that was so '80s for us."" I would guess that alien music is something that I can't even imagine. I would love to be able to say, ""Oh yeah, alien music sounds just like our album."" But I'm pretty sure it doesn't. So what does it sound like? I couldn't begin to have any idea. I would hope it's something that would blow my mind with how crazy it sounds. I'm sure it's like nothing I could even imagine. I often think about what if some classical composers, like Beethoven or Tchaikovsky or whoever, what if they were hearing music that's being made today, how would they feel about that? Do you have any theories? Would they hate it? Would they be like Baby Boomers listening to hip-hop? I really don't know. They might be impressed by some of it. I don't think they could even conceive of a sampler. It would blow their minds to even imagine something like that. You can record a sound and distort it and create a new sound from it. That's what I think it'd be like hearing alien music. I'd be hearing techniques and technology that we can't even imagine. I'd be like Mozart listening to dubstep. Centipede Hz is out September 4 on Domino. Read Hive's interview with Deakin here and Geologist here . ",6,1
"After surviving this line today, I'm exhausted, dumbfounded but mostly enraged at our Republican Govenor Rick Scott for reducing the early voting period in Florida.  According to the official wait times tracking website, the lines were 4 hours today in Aventura.  I'd reckon that most folks today waited at least double that time ... it took me 9 hours! The line was so long it is difficult to make out, but it snaked many times back to the trees at the back of the picture and started with a winding row down a flight of stairs to the left. I doubt most folks here will ever forget this day.  Democracy is being challenged but the people will persevere and win this fight. 9:16 PM PT : Thanks everyone!  I've been humbled twice ... by the dedicated folks who selflessly stood in line and the kind recognition of the community here! A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for ""Barack Obama,"" is this a diary they'd be trying to find? Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office. If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race. Tags do not compound: that is, ""education reform"" is a completely different tag from ""education"". A tag like ""reform"" alone is probably not meaningful. The racial makeup of the county was 60.90% White , 29.50% Black or African American, 0.40% Native American, 4.20% Asian, 0.10% Pacific Islander, 2.10% from other races, and 2.90% from two or more races. 7.90% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. The racial makeup of the county was 75.17% White , 14.96% Black or African American, 0.39% Native American, 2.20% Asian, 0.07% Pacific Islander, 4.66% from other races, and a 2.56% from two or more races. 17.99% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. Are you ready to Vote? Are you still 'allowed' to Vote? -- Are you sure? A poll worker will come out and get people who are in wheel chairs or who have an obvious disability. That being said, there are reports here on DK from voters who suffer from disabilities that are NOT obvious - arthritis, fibromyalgia, heart conditions, people who have had hip or knee replacement - they may all look fine, but they're not. I think if they have a card in their wallet (that they would have to have for air travel), they can use that to get moved up, but if they don't, they're SOL. ""Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential."" - Barack Obama front of the line because he has leg issues and I have had two hip replacement surgeries.  We did not ask for special treatment, but the staff were observant and noted our walking skills, or the lack thereof....LOL  The staff in Miami Dade County at the Library in South Dade were so thoughtful and so caring that I almost forgot they were working.  They took us to chairs, and had a person stand in line with numbers for us and when our numbers were called, we voted.  It took about two hours, and we were sitting the whole time except when we had to go upstairs.  We took the elevator, got to our seats, and moved right along.  It was crowded but everyone was in good spirits, and talked, laughed, and discussed the issues of the day. What a pleasant way to spend some time doing what is a right and obligation! Thank you, South Dade, for showing how it should work! BTW:  Rick ""Snott"" Scott will be repaid for his deliberate inaction when it comes to accommodating the public....and it will hurt, Ricky! As my friend said,"" I am not renting out space in my head to anybody."" Voting shouldn't be this hard. I live in a small town in upstate NY and just can't fathom waiting 4 hours, let along 9 hours, to vote. Love to see those long lines of Pro-Obama voters in the Pix, though. It was always obvious that democracy would take a hit - real or attempted - by the forces of negativity in this election.  Those forces were enraged when Obama won in '08. Now they're just totally bonkers. She hasn't voted yet.  She's upset with me that I'm going to see the President today and that I'm taking a vacation day on Tuesday to help one of the OFA volunteer groups. She said ""I'm sorry, but that man has no place in the White House.  Black people are not supposed to be there -  he has no business being there."" I've known for years she was prejudiced, she constantly reminds me ""Obama is black, you know.""   Yeah, mom, I know - but I'm like MLK - I'll judge somebody on their character, not their color. When she said that to me last night - I blew up.  I called her an ignorant bigot.  My mother is 86.  I know I can never change her, but I was so angry and upset last night.  She lives 300 miles away, I go up there every 6 weeks to take care of things around the house, deal with some of her financial things she doesn't understand (her IRA that my dad left her), help her run errands that she can't do alone.... but I just hate her attitude.  She wonders what is ""wrong"" with me and where she went wrong raising me.  See, I'm supposed to be an ignorant bigot, too. I am sick over this.  Is everybody in the Greatest Generation like this?  I've been sorry that we're losing our WWII generation by the thousands - but if they're all like this, then the generational die off isn't happening fast enough - and that includes my mom, whom I love, but right now I don't like her very much at all. I call her every evening at 8:30.  I don't know if I can even talk to her tonight. ""Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential."" - Barack Obama from nursing home care via the block granting of Medicaid (assuming her IRA is not the size of Mitt's). Not all seniors are that way by any means, but the proportion gets higher in older groups. I am 71, but that puts me in a group that came of political age during the civil rights movement. My impression is that anyone older is more likely to cling to racism than those younger though their are 20something bigots too. It is the most depressing thing about this election -- those who have the most to lose with Romney in power are the most likely to vote for him. My father was a terrible bigot but my mother was the most open and tolerant person I ever knew. It is OK to be mad at your parents for being stupid or wrong. And if you can not talk to her for a couple of days that is OK too. Just remember that we are all imperfect beings in an imperfect world and that our parents never really measured up to who we thought they were. my mother, who is 89, has been a lifelong democrat. we have had many a politically charged conversation the two of us. I'm so sorry your mother isn't of the same mind as you. you're right that you can't change her.  My sister and I are on opposite political sides so I kinda know what you're going through.  I gave up trying to convince her of the error of her ways, there is no point. Many times I've seen her get mad when people attacked Mormonism. Last night, though - she told me that she had hoped a lot of people would decide they couldn't vote for Romney because he IS a Mormon. I was surprised to hear her say that. She shares my feelings for Mitt Romney - utter loathing. She can see the lack of compassion in him, same as the rest of us, and he creeps her out (me too). Mom doesn't like getting into political discussions, though - because sometimes people forget who they're talking to, and get rude, or mean. Or just stupid. She's got a temper, but doesn't like to use it. :) My mom is amazing. ""We have only the moral ground we actually inhabit, not the moral ground we claim."" - It Really Is That Important would be 82 and 84 and they were advocates for equality and ciivil rights. However my grandmother on my dad's side was racist. And he would allow us as kids to challenge her and even make fun of her racist views. He did not consider that disrespectful and he was big on respecting one's elders. But he would not tolerate racism or hate going unchallenged and he was proud that we felt the same way. I think we should always challlenge racism and if it means getting into a fight and blowing up, so bit it,  if the person truly loves us, they will respect our views and know we cannto accept their bigotry. The worst mistake we can make is not challenging hate and bigotry even if it means some blow ups and lost friendship and estranged family members at times. If people spew bigotry and hate, I call them out..I always have and always will. And if they do not like it, tough,...they can make a choice as to what is more important in their lives and live with the consequences. She voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and was proud to do so, although she was for Hillary in the primary and was disappointed she didn't win. She was as thrilled as I was when it was announced that Obama won. I was living with her and taking care of her at the time. The first black president prompted us to talk about racism that she saw in the South before the civil rights movement. She told me that she hated how blacks were treated, and things she saw happen on the busses, for instance that made her angry, though she never felt able to act or speak out. I have two brothers who are both right wingers, one of them is clearly racist. Mom, and Dad (who died in 2006, both Roosevelt Democrats, never knew where they went wrong with them. I don't know why some people are  racists, and some aren't even though they were surrounded by it all their lives. If we could figure that out, we could really solve a lot of problems. to allow ANYONE to spew racist crap in your presence. I say ""tell her you love her,"" yes.  But tell her too that you don't care to hear about her bigoted ideas and she needs to respect that. There's nothing loving about what this mother is doing or saying to her son in this regard. Loving would be allowing him to be the adult he is, make up his own mind about who he's going to vote for and why. Most importantly, she'll be happier if she respects her son's rights to his beliefs, instead of driving him away. ""A typical vice of American politics is the avoidance of saying anything real on real issues."" Theodore Roosevelt. ate speech ever, not under any circumstances. We must always confront it and make it known where we draw the line in the sand. If people want a relationship with me, I tell them they have to respect me on this as I will not tolerate hate speech and racism. Life is too short and too precious to put up with hate speech and bigotry as it is toxic.  What a person can do though is let the parent know their hate speech and racist talk will not be tolerated in one 's presence. Hang up on these people, they will get the message. The bigoted mother may not change her views but she sure as hell can stop spewing that talk in the presence of the child or over the phone. It is OK to draw lines and boundaries with elderly relatives. It leds to better communication if they respect those boundaries and refrain from hate speech when talking to you. My Mom and Stepfather are both more tolerant. In fact, I told my Mom about MSNBC a few years ago and she absolutely has to watch Rachel Maddow every night (her name usually comes up when we're on the phone ;-) -- and this from a person who voted for Bush in 2004! ""like this""... but there's research to show that your mom can't help it. Really. Older adults lose their inhibitory ability - so they say things that make their kids hair stand on end, things that even if they had spent 80 years privately thinking them would have never come out of their mouths in front of others. My own grandmother was a lovely, wonderful woman, but int he last years of her life, WHOA - her sons never thought she'd ever knew some of those words. And her nurses, when she was in the home... I can't tell you what she said in front of some of them! Here's an article that's been around a while, that might give you some comfort and understanding. Taking care of an elderly person is one of the most emotionally challenging things you can do - and having to travel 300 miles to do it must be exhausting! I hope, for your sake, that you can line up some support for yourself during this last season of your lives with your mom. It's absolutely wonderful that you have taken off days to do things YOU want, for the world YOU want to make.. and that part of your motivation in volunteering for Obama is because you are looking to protect the elderly, people like your mom, who truly can't protect themselves or vote in their own interests. s and they learned to restrain themselves and to respect boundaries as their kids would set boundaries for them not to cross and they abided by them. My parents would not tolerate my grandparents bigotry, disrepect,  periods of rage and anger, and other such behaivor.  They drew lines in the sand and my grandmother got to the point where she did not cross those lines out of respect and love for my parents. But sometimes it's not so simple as ""taking a hard line"" - my own Grandmom had issues with dementia. When a family member has or develops a disability that has cognitive and/or behavioral issues, adult or child, the simplistic response of setting boundaries is not practical or helpful. Also, advanced age, and the onset of fragility, comes at different rates for different people. cannot be expect to honor and respect boundaries. But there  are a lot of parents and grandparents who are older that do not have dementia but go into this bullying thing and that should be nipped in the bud. My father knows that he is still a bigot and only made worse by mindless allegiance to Fox News. He has heard me blow up about his voting efforts that ultimately hurt his own children and grandchildren. I like him less these days as a person with identifiable qualities, but he is still my father and I have decades-old familial love and a sense of responsibilities to him that compel me to communicate and work on essentials. However, I speak to him less freely and for shorter periods of time, nowadays.  People can change at any stage of their lives if in decent enough health, I feel - he's had his chance many times over and is only getting worse in my eyes. We should never stop appreciating what they've done for us over the years that was generous, helpful and healthy, or at least intended to be so.  But, the terms of rearing children should also be open-ended: we need not live within the confines of their beliefs as we grow and mature. In fact, they should fully expect that we will become our own people as we grow - otherwise, they risk being selfish parents who want to see living, breathing versions of themselves outside the mirror. Perform your duties and responsibilities, but there is no need to respect their qualities which degrade their character - and especially which happen to harm you - in your eyes.  I would suggest keeping communications to a minimum outside the basics and already-common subjects that have kept you bonded, at least for a time.  It works for me and keeps frustration levels lower. ""So, please stay where you are. Don't move and don't panic. Don't take off your shoes! Jobs is on the way."" to refrain from airing his bigoted views in your presence and basically to put a Lid on It around you ?  If he respects you , he will do so when you are around or the phone with you. I think it is not too much to ask our parents to respect our opinions and to respect how we chose to live our lives. Many would be surprised how parents respond when you draw a line in the sand and ask them to respect that, most will do so rather than lose the adult child or piss of the adult child.  Now there are some toxic and dsyfunctional parents like my mother in law who cut off myhusband years ago because she refused to show any respect for him and was very , very abusive. But usually most parents will respect their adult kids enough to not talk about their hate and spew it around an adult child who objects to it. I commend you - many if not most people share the political views of their parents. Pity her and continue to be the dutiful, loving child that you obviously are. Those in the ""greatest generation"" have many wonderful qualities, but they were not given that moniker on the basis of their political beliefs, but rather on their shared sense of duty and sacrifice during the war. My own parents are if anything more progressive than I am. My father has always admired communism in theory (""it just hasn't worked in practice"")  and as a doctor has always advocated for a national, single-payer health plan. However, I remember when I dated a black boy in high school both of them were alarmed and disapproving. Some prejudices take generations - and changing demographics - to dissipate. My dad is a 78year old white guy in east Texas and has been a liberal all his life. Years ago, probably at a Sunday dinner with my grandparents, he was ranting and raving about racist white people, he remarked that he hated white people. My grandmother piped up that he was white and he replied ""that is your fault, not mine."". He also gets a kick nowadays of telling people ""I voted for the Kenyan even though he is a damned moderate not a liberal"" My mom is 87 and had a injury about 5 weeks ago. I've been taking care of her and we've had some really great conversations about this election. She always ends our conversations with ""how come everyone doesn't know these things?"". Sadly I have to tell her that some people are so used to living with their bigotry and falsehoods that the truth cannot get through to them. But I also tell her their numbers are dwindling. The younger generation are more tolerant of differences. She's finally come around on her thoughts about gay marriage. She doesn't embrace the idea, but she now says it isn't up to her what others do. It's a start. Growing up, out right racism in our house was not allowed. Using the 'n' word would have brought us a bar of soap to our mouth. But, I still remember overhearing my dad and mom discussing the first black family that moved onto our street. The words ""property value"" are ones I remember. It was years later that I understood the racism in their words. and passed the Voting Rights Act and all the other civil rights and anti-poverty legislation of the Sixties. Boomers were most of the people in the streets, but the people in power, Kennedy, Johnson, Humphrey, etc, were your mother's generation & older. She is 76.  She keeps telling me that I've been contrary since I was little.  (contrary=questioning authority)  I blew up at her.  Can't fucking stand the incessant holier than thou bs anymore. I will be soooooo estatic when the President is re-elected.  I really want to rub her face in it.  Her asshole husband's too. Told her all about the rally and how excited I was to be able to see and hear the President in person and take pictures. She's been like this her whole life.  My dad was, too.  It's partly the way they were raised - both born in the mid-1920's, in Germantown, PA. My mother's family came from Germany in the 1850's.  My dad is an anchor baby - his parents came from Ireland through Ellis Island, met and married in the US and had him and his sister (they became naturalized shortly before dad was born). The neighborhood they lived in was divided into ethnic groups - Italians, Irish, Germans, Polish, Black, Puerto Ricans, a few ""Asians"" - and they all called each other by typical slurring names.  My dad called my uncle that ""crazy wop"" forever - it was good natured after my uncle married my dad's sister, but before that wops, spics, chinks, n-word... that's just they way they classified each other. He was infuriated that my son's best friend in cub scouts was a little boy from Haiti.  They put up their first tent together and I have a picture of the two of them, ear to ear grins (with the typical missing front tooth gap of a 7 year old), with their arms around each others' shoulders, so proud of their lopsided tent.  My dad said who's the little ""nxxxxx"" kid?  I was appalled - DAD!  Can you please not use that word in front of Ryan?? My dad had a good heart, as does my mom, but they just can't get past the past.  They were both Ike Republicans and they just didn't get that those Republicans are not the same Republicans that we have now.  My dad passed away in 2007.  I'm an only child so my mom has nobody but me.  She won't come to live with me - refuses to leave her house up there, hates south Florida (although she lived here from 1947-1981) because ""nobody speaks English there any more.""  She can't understand why I don't just quit my job and move in with her - after all, SHE didn't work once she had me, she thinks it's awful that my own son grew up in day care from the time he was 6 weeks old.  I don't think he turned out so bad - Salutatorian in high school, Eagle Scout (although he's embarrassed about that now - he hates THEIR bigoted stance on gay people), graduated with high honors from UF, went to vet school at UI, has been a practicing vet for 6 years, got married, bought a home... and he has friends from every background / race that's on the planet. My parents didn't understand him either - how can he be friends with people who are not like him?  I don't get THEIR attitude... I just don't get it - but you learn to deal with it the best you can - I just really blew up last night because I'm so sick of her saying President Obama does not ""belong"" in the White House.  Here is a good man, a smart man, somebody who gives a shit about every American out here, somebody who was elected, fair and square by a majority of the American people - I guess we're all crazy. I have to put my pix from today in Photobucket and make a little diary.  I'm exhausted and sunburned, so gonna hit the sack and will try to upload my pix tomorrow after work. Thank you for all the encouraging replies - I'm sooo glad to know that not every member of her age group is bigoted and that other non-bigoted children of people like my mom are also having to deal with it.  I probably won't yell at her for awhile - with the election over and all those stupid ads stopping, she won't be so cranky (and neither will I!) ""Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential."" - Barack Obama First, my deepest, deepest thanks to all those people who withstood a nine-hour wait. Second, I hope that everyone in that line, and everyone who sees or hears about it, will remember that there were no such lines in Florida in 2010, when Gov. Scott was elected.  He's the anti-democratic bastard who made that line possible, because he didn't want those people to vote. So in the next off-year election, everyone in that line, and everyone they know -- they all need to vote that bastard out of office and vote into office someone who cares enough about democracy to allow full and open access to the ballot box.  Without nine-hour lines. mixed income mixed race neighborhood. NO PROBLEM with lines. because no one wants to impede people from voting there needs to be a law that states need to allow voting to happen in a certain time period, beyond which it can be said they are impeding voting and violating the voting rights act (or something like that) that makes voting such an endurance test for some of it's citizens. In Dublin, a fairly large busy city, where I've voted for thirty years in a variety of locations both well off and poor, I've never had to wait at all to vote. Not for local elections, European elections, referendums, national elections or Presidential elections. Never. And we all vote on the one day and have no postal voting and still it's a quick and easy process. It just doesn't make sense that it should be this difficult in the wealthiest nation in the world. And it should be done as soon after this election as possible. Maybe we can rise above some of the bullshit if congress critters aren't quite so in campaign mode. We should take a page out of ?ALEC?'s book, cobble together a broad plan, and just start hitting our representatives/senators with it. And before the mail-only purists chime in...remember the story from Friday about the clerk in Oregon that was filling in blank circles with GOP straight ticket.  There has to be auditing of the process...and the partisan nature of election commissions strains the process.  There are often no quality standards met across a county, let alone a state. I poll clerked in 2006 in Jack Layton's former riding (Toronto-Danforth).  The lines weren't super busy, mind you, but there was a general high level of respect for the process by partisans and non-partisans and wanting to make sure every vote was counted properly - vote count scrutineering is permitted with one representative per party. We had to sign off on the station's results (both the clerk and me the deputy clerk).  The votes (paper marked with an x) were sealed shut in a plastic bag with signatures, then sealed in one box with the voters list with another signature seal, and then that box was put into another box with other Elections Canada general documents and signed/sealed again.  These final boxes were given to the riding (district) election returning officer (or a deputy) and they were taken to the riding administrative office.  They would be unsealed only on a judge's order (i.e. for a recount if the thresholds were met by law). Seriously, what's the difficulty? ""now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."" W. Churchill in the U.S. it is an aspiration. The Constitution established the formal framework, but legislated inequality from the start. Participation was severally restricted and some humans weren't considered even whole persons. Turning the aspiration into reality has been a tortuous process. Even the enfranchisement of the entire adult population didn't happen until a mere four decades ago. Then, for the next three decades it was a rubber stamp occasion. While candidates for public office often appeared to be self-selected, most were actually chosen in various kinds of smoke-filled rooms. Participatory democracy is in its infancy. Indeed, in New England, the prototypical town meeting is being phased out in favor of ""professional"" administration by people who make decisions based on cost in an environment where the flow of money is constricted by the banksters. Withholding funds has turned out to be a lot easier than arguing communal need. Withholding funds has turned out to be a satisfying route to power. Just saying no is a power play. I don't know any large country where national voting is not managed by a national board. I don't know any country were partisan elected officials manage the voting. Where you can tag along many other local elections and questions and amendment and what not so filling up a ballot takes 10 minutes or more, for those who do it. Where the actual voting system changes by county and by state. A system for voting designed at the end of the eighteen century when only a third of the population of the country could actually vote but just having ballots mailed out that people could fill out from home if they so desired would be great, too.  (One potential problem with this is that people could more easily control the votes of others). Then you wouldn't have people filling out a 10 page ballot while others wait behind them.  Just makes no sense, living in the states would baffle your mind thor....Especially the south.   The red stronghold and dictator type of governing and flat out craziness is as bad as any uncivilized country.   It is sad, but Scott's politicial days are numbered because there is a huge effort, even with the old republican types to rid us of this corrupt POS.  The more I am here, the more I am convinced he stole Florida.    Can't find many who admit they voted for him. We the People have to make a difference and the Change.....Just do it ! Be part of helping us build a veteran community online. United Veterans of America in Florida. People stand in line at Disney World all the time. People spend hours sitting in traffic jams. A regular Sunday church service takes three hours, though that does involve sitting some of the time. That's why it's a good idea to bring chairs to the polls. If people can wait three hours to get in to see the President, they can wait to cast a vote for many candidates. The cons are lazy. That's why they think people will be discouraged by the physical exertion of standing in line. special provisions for physically handicapped persons. In some voting districts, I was informed yesterday, poll workers come to the curb with an electronic machine so a handicapped person need not exit the vehicle. Apparently, such provisions must be demanded by citizens. to address this. The board of supervisors or the supervisor of elections needs to be contacted during their down time, preferably in connection with budget considerations to insure that adequate provisions are planned for and included. This is a long term effort. Dollars are not determinative, but they do provide a good handle to exert some pressure. I don't think it was anticipated that part time legislators would use their power over the purse and public resources to insure their continuation in office (nobody expected that legislative bodies would become sinecures for people who have no practical talents), but since they do that, they have to be called out on the conflict involved in restricting the participation of the electorate to which they are supposed to respond. They need to be made to understand that the law is not designed to let them rule. Scott. He was very clear about what he would do in regard to voting. We saw this coming from miles away. And we started to fight on this issue right after Scott took office. Funding has been cut resources diverted, hours shortened, voter registrations challenged on many fronts. This has been a part of a plan. Not a CT but a public acknowledge and publicly discussed and debated plan. The whole rotten system in Florida is corrupt through and through. And there is no end in sight. Corruption has been around since prehistory and our system here in Florida is designed to be corruption friendly. Nine hours in a line? At Disney, to use your example, they would hand out fast passes to balance the load. Disney is designed to manage huge crowds and they foresee 99% of all eventualities. Your preferred example might be Universal or Six Flags. But if this election were run by Disney you would be in and out within two hours and have your picture taken with Cinderella on your way out through the gift shop. And hours would be extended until 3:00 AM to handle the crowd. No one should have to wait any lengthy time to vote in this country. There simply is no justification and no coincidence that 99% of the time those waits happen in poor and minority heavy places. Over the last 28 years, I've voted in my small, Connecticut home town (pop.3500), Boston, NYC, Stamford, CT and my new smallish, Connecticut town. The longest I've ever waited was in Stamford and that took all of 15 minutes because they were having a problem with two of those old mechanical, pull the lever machines. No one would have to take extra time to get accommodations if adequate voting facilities were provided.  No one would have to hope for good weather, or the good nature of politicians and officials.  No would have to fend off intimidation. And YES, we do expect that politicians and officials will and have throughout history used the power of the purse and public resources to insure their continuation in office and the hold on that power it provides. This IS a long term fight, and it's been going on forever.   I ask again, are you really that naive or am I not getting the snark in your comments? The priest said, ""Today's sermon is called 'Liars', but first I have a question. How many of you have read Chapter 66 in Matthew?"" Nearly every hand went up. ""You're just the group I need to speak to,"" the priest said. ""There's no such chapter."" were targeted for deprivation and abuse. Then equal treatment arrived on the scene and the proponents did not consider that equal could encompass shoddy and that the ideal would be used to treat everyone worse. Nor, even though there's a long history of deprivation of rights under cover of law, was it anticipated that legislators would again resort to the law to subordinate the citizens they are supposed to serve. Our legislative bodies on the national and state level have been good at pointing the finger at the executive. But, the laws legislators passed in Tallahassee and the allocation of insufficient funds to pay for adequate voting facilities and processes was done by legislators, just as the AUMF and the Defense Authorization Act which permits domestic spying with drones was passed by Congress.  Pointing the finger at the executive who subscribes his John Hancock to the bills is not just disingenuous, it's deceptive. The long time political class in Florida, both Republican and Democratic has been exploitative. The wetlands were drained, the fish were killed off, and the forest resources were used up by exploiters -- people who take things to market for a profit and put nothing back. Because Florida was not part of the South before the Civil War, the locals pride themselves on being different, but, for all intents and purposes, the influx of retirees from other states was prompted by exploiters who consciously stinted on social services so that when the young retirees got old and needy, they'd be prompted to go back where they came from. The social infrastructure sucks almost as bad as the physical, which has to be constantly rebuilt because of shoddy work in the first place. I'm not naive, but I also don't have a lot of patience for wailing on election day. We've known since before 2000 that Florida is a mess and twelve years later nothing has changed. Republicans got a foot hold in Florida because Democrats were corrupt and self-serving. Government in the sunshine laws did make it possible for citizens to become involved, but few bothered and now, as far as I can tell, the laws are being steadily eroded. Yes, incompetent exploiters we will always have with us. They must be restrained and that task is never done because we keep producing more of them. Having to stand in line waiting to vote is the least of Florida's problems. But, that people are turning out to vote is a good sign. Also, that the dereliction of duty can be quantified in dollars is a good sign. Having to stand in line for hours not the least of Florida's problems.  It is at the root.  When voting rights are suppressed,  and waiting for hours clearly suppresses voting, all that stems from them is challenged.  If this basic right, the backbone of democracy is so easily made the least of our problems, then we have truly have no real democracy. Voting in this country has become so unimportant precisely because that is what is desired by those who want to limit it, namely the plutocracy, the oligarchs, the captains of industry, the monopolists, the crooks, liars, and bigots, etc.  They are getting what they want and most of America just shrugs. When the so many believe that they're vote doesn't count, that the fix is in, or the system is rigged, do we really have a democracy? I have to go now, so please forgive if you respond and I don't get back to you for a while.  I'm headed out to help make sure our polling locations here in town are ready for tomorrow.  Just got word that the power is back on at the schools. The priest said, ""Today's sermon is called 'Liars', but first I have a question. How many of you have read Chapter 66 in Matthew?"" Nearly every hand went up. ""You're just the group I need to speak to,"" the priest said. ""There's no such chapter."" the good news is that absentee voting is unrestricted in Florida, just request a ballot and it will be mailed to you.  I dont think i would have been able to vote this year because of my disability.  I drove past an early voting place in Polk County today, the Lakeland Government Center, and lines were far out the door.  Four years ago the lines were short and all inside the building. ...sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without a passport,whereas Virtue, if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers. from The Sermon, Moby Dick would not choose to stand in line to see them at a rally --lots of elderly people, lots of folks who have jobs that they have to get to, people who could not stand that long, etc. They should not have to wait 3 hours, or 8 hours, to vote! Yes, it's a nice time of year in Florida but waiting hours to vote is ridiculous. ""At stake are not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of social justice and the character of our country."" ~Sen. Ted Kennedy an attempt to excuse the inexcusable. There is no constitutional right nor no civic duty to stand in line at Disney World or to go to church for three hours on Sunday (seriously? People spend three hours in church?!). For the young and healthy it may not be too much of an endurance test but many people find queueing even when sitting very painful and young mothers with children would be severely compromised as well. If it was as difficult to vote in my country as it is  for some citizens in yours then I would have been only able to vote a fraction of the time instead of having a thirty year 100% record. It's disgraceful. the voter suppression - leaving the GOP legislature blameless!  And of course, GOPers are silent as voting lines extend for blocks and voters wait in lines up to 9 hours to vote - courtesy of the GOP legislature! somehow there are always plenty of voting machines for suburban whites, and never enough for inner city people of color.  Even on election day, the photos of lines tend to be heavily African-American, in places like Ohio. lenty of suburban whites. At the one early voting location in the county guaranteed to have plenty of suburban fundie white Republicans going there. Voting machines in every corner they could put them. Line in the shade. The line was at least half African-American. That's nowhere NEAR the racial breakdown of that neighborhood or the county as a whole. But if you take public transportation you may still add 2-3 hours each way to your vote time just to reach someplace without a 4-8 hour line. And depending on work schedule, how much you can pay a baby sitter, how much else you have to get done just to live, you may not have those extra hours either to stand in line to vote or to sit on a bus.

Londo Mollari if a habitat is flooded, the improvement for target fishes increases by an infinite percentage...because a habitat suitability index that is even a tiny fraction of 1 is still infinitely higher than zero, which is the suitability of dry land to fishes. If you work in the service, retail, fast food or medical industries, you're still working on national holidays. Often times you're working even on Thanksgiving and Christmas. And those are the work places filled with the working poor who are the same ones waiting in those long lines. ""Madness! Total and complete madness!

We live in a suburban area in OH and have never had to wait to vote, whether voting early or on election day, not even 5 minutes. It's not fair, but until people wake up, get active, and vote out Republican governors and secretaries of state, it's not likely to get better.  Gerrymandering stacks the legislature against us, which makes winning state wide elections critical to block the Republican right wing agenda. The judicial system has been some help, but governors like Scott feel free to ignore the courts as well as public opinion.  If Republicans get control, the court appointees will not be sympathetic to voting rights. said rebelle. I think Rick Scott and his ilk deseve a prison sentence. In spite of them this will be a win for Obama and Democracy. Thank you Florida Democrats and like minded independents.. You are awesome. ""America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between"" Oscar Wilde should be run against the Secretary of State and any other obstructing official whose responsibility involves elections. If these people know they're going to get pounded for their intransigence, it might have a beneficial effect. ""Yes, reason has been a part of organized religion, ever since two nudists took dietary advice from a talking snake."" - Jon Stewart; The Daily Show and who ever runs against him (whether Alex Sink runs again or the Dems put up someone else), they have a LOT of fodder to run against Scott.  He is fucking AWFUL, and the damaging he's doing will take time to undo.  I remember waking up to the ""Rick Scott narrowly becomes Florida's new Governor"" and I was like - NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO... God my state can be so STOOOOPID. It's all the Repubs in the Florida legislature. Democrats must take back both houses and the governorship - and then redistrict immediately. Forget the 10-year thing, the gerrymandering is facilitating the destruction of the state. Actually from what I can see districts have been drawn more compactly as required by the fair districts constitutional amendments--the reason Republicans dominate the state legislature is that they are the only organized party that holds real power in the state, and of course they have money out the wazoo...they are a united force and their fanatics vote consistently, unlike Democrats who move to Florida but treat it like being on permanent vacation rather than a state where they are involved in civic life. Try looking at this .  Notice how district 9 is completely surrounded by district 4?  Any guesses who lives in that squid district 9?  Poorer people.  Black people.  Democrats.  Notice the tiny strip of riverfront property at the bottom, that's in 4?  That's the Jacksonville elite, along with some middle class folks like me. On the national level, Corrine Brown's district is still that ugly snake of a map twisting its way through a third of the state, so as to create an overwhelmingly Democratic district - leaving the others comfortably Republican. if a habitat is flooded, the improvement for target fishes increases by an infinite percentage...because a habitat suitability index that is even a tiny fraction of 1 is still infinitely higher than zero, which is the suitability of dry land to fishes. You can't have a line like that and not have some system for getting people back to the same spot in line for things like going to the bathroom. Not unless you're going to be entirely inhumane (which, granted, undersupplying machines to the tune of a 9-hour-line is completely symptomatic of anyway, but...). A kind woman actually called her brother to bring some food and drinks for six of us ... I don't think a complete stranger has ever done something like for me before but the moment, I think, really brought folks together. of all the PISSED OFF turnout that are sending a message to the FL Gov.

I'll contribute. if a habitat is flooded, the improvement for target fishes increases by an infinite percentage...because a habitat suitability index that is even a tiny fraction of 1 is still infinitely higher than zero, which is the suitability of dry land to fishes. and thanks to all those Floridians who showed that criminal of a Governor that he won't take away your vote. Honestly -- besides the reduced days -- there should be more polling sites for early voting.  He is a total bastard.  I hope the DOJ is keeping details on every single polling place and that Scott gets slammed after the election. most people around me were very casual about the whole experience.  I think people were trying to be positive.  Also, since everyone was strangers, I think people did not want to risk getting into a heated political discussion for the next 9 hours! When I brought it up that this was a result of the reduced voting hours, folks certainly were already well-aware of the changess but none actually took the bait to complain/elaborate so I let it drop. What I don't understand is, why don't they have MORE voting booths in the early voting locations? There are so few of them compared to how many polling locations there are on election day. We had only 20 where I voted (West Boca Raton library). although she's not the best SofE (there have already been issues with absentee ballots). So, no, it's really not that obvious an answer and it is a valid question.  Unless the answer is that pRick Scott decides how many voting booths each early voting election is allocated (I assumed it was up to each county's SofE, but maybe I'm wrong).  Otherwise, since early voting ends 2 full days prior to Election Day, there's no reason why there can't be 40-50 voting booths at the few early voting locations around the county (Palm Beach is a LARGE county, as is Miami-Dade). He knows full well that early voting was what helped Obama cruise to victory in Florida the last time around and he's determined to prevent that from happening again. We have SUCH a plan for that guy when his term is up, you see. We're going to make sure that he's not re-elected as governor. But we're fighting one battle at a time. Meanwhile, rumor has it that none other that Charlie Crist (the former Republican governor of Florida who ran for a senate seat and lost) is planning a comeback---as a Democrat this time--- and that he plans to run for governor again. This should get interesting. vote enough in mid term elections. Actually I was talking about the strange phenomena of Republican governors in staunch Dem states with other politics nerds on our Irish politics site yesterday. Could this be why that seems to be a relatively common occurrence? The lack of voting in midterms by dems? there was no way in hell I could have done that.  Even with a stool it would have been very difficult.  I am sure there are lots of disabled people who would vote but can't.  Hopefully they are voting absentee--and hopefully that vote is not being thrown out or not counted. We should not be fighting about equal pay for equal work and access to birth control in 2012. Elizabeth Warren some relatives and friends of the family vote in that people over a certain age (somewhere in the 70s) or using assistive tech to get around automatically get cut to the front. I'm assuming the poll staff who manage that (they'll tell you if you're eligible when you get in line even if you don't know about the policy) would probably include people with non-assisted visible trouble walking in the definition. in Utah, and even that was enough to stress my knees! Standing is harder on the joints than walking. 9 hours? I'd be curled up on the ground. Chairs would help, but the repeated getting up and down from the chair to move up would strain the knees too. I did have to find a second location in the suburbs, as the first location had such a long line that they were cutting people off/ encouraging them to try a different location. At the second location, the poll workers looked to be willing to stay as long as it took. People were still getting into line after the cutoff time. yeah, Utah, my national votes won't make a dent, but I was happy to add to the popular vote total. There has got to be a way to address these long lines in the big state urban areas. It's been going on for years now. Any chance of national legislation mandating tying numbers of machines to numbers of registered voters? Does that pass constitutional muster? Otherwise, yes, TOSS THE GOP OFFICIALS overseeing the suppression. 2010 really brought a toxic crowd into both state govts and Congress. It's intolerable. of voting.  Between the travesties in Michigan, the dishonesty in Florida and Ohio, and the shenanigans in Waukesha County, WI, it is clear that there needs to be uniformity and supervision.  But getting Congress to take up the issue is another thing entirely. We should not be fighting about equal pay for equal work and access to birth control in 2012. Elizabeth Warren The west coast is truly the model for the rest of the nation.  Many of the other states so badly bungle voting that they make our country look like a laughing stock.  But not us in the west.  Of course we do take forever to count up our ballots. ...voting here has always been a breeze. Want to vote early at an early voting location?  Just drop in. Want a mail-in ballot?  Just ask.  Want to be on the Permanent Early Voting List so that you always get a mail-in ballot?  Just fill out a simple card.  Didn't mail your ballot in?  Drop it off at a polling place.  Oh, and if you want to vote in person on November 6th, you can do that. I've never spent more than ten minutes at a polling place.  It should be this easy everywhere. Early voting here is fairly busy, but never a hassle. The king here is voting by mail. I think I heard in Pima County this year that 60% of voters have gotten mail in ballots. Both parties vote heavily by mail. No one except a few fringe wacko wingnuts want to get rid of vote by mail - especially not elected officials. It's how they got voted in, after all. is awful.  In CA I was on a permanent mail ballot option.  Each election I'd get my ballot well in advance of election day and I could fill it out and mail it in....no hassles.  Better yet, I got non-biased information about the candidates, who they were (important for lower offices) and a brief statement from them. Even better was the detailed information on ballot initiatives...always a quagmire in CA because many of them are underwritten by special interests and can often have misleading titles.  All of this and Internet research really helps you feel you know who and what you are voting for. In PA...swing state...an absolute tsunami of totally awful advertising (and from both sides unfortunately).  Trying to make an argument in 30 or 60 seconds about important issues out to be outlawed. Then we have the long battle over Voter ID...the Repubs pushed it through....the courts after detailed arguments said it will not be imposed at least for this election.....and the Repubs are STILL running ads about Voter ID to try and increase the confusion. No independent advance information available about candidates or issues either.  You are totally on your own. Instead, you get the state spending 5 million bucks they don't have for education or health care to a GOP hack PR firm to ""explain"" the now-defunct Voter ID law to the voters...a law which they had to admit in court, was pushed through a GOP Legislature despite the fact that they could not cite a single case of voter fraud in the state. Worse yet, as a newcomer it is often hard to tell whether the ad you are seeing is for a candidate you can actually vote for or against....what is their district?  Are you in it?  We need national laws on voter qualification and a system which fairly allocates voting machines so classes of citizens aren't systematically and unfairly forced to endure denial of early voting, long waits in lines and artificial impediments to being allowed to vote. For everyone else: WA is 100% vote-by-mail.  Every registered voter with a valid mailing address gets a ballot and is expected to return that ballot at the price of a postage stamp (poll tax = &lt;$0.50 per person). It has drawbacks, but it's still the best deal until we can all do 100% internet voting (free via public library). On an ornery and arrogant note: Ain't all you all doing the same thing? You can also drop it off at the nearest drop-box 24 hrs a day (till election day, when the cut-off is 8 pm), or ballot collection van (those are more temporary). Price of gas, bus fare, or if you already have a bus pass or live in walking distance, then you can do it for free. I'm curious, though, why you don't think it's easier to fill out your ballot in the comfort of your own home, wearing pj's & fuzzy slippers if you want, enjoying pizza or bon-bons, seated in a nice soft chair with as much time as you need to read through the pamphlet and make your choices. ""These are not candidates. These are the empty stand-ins for lobbyists' policies to be legislated later."" - Chimpy, 9/24/10 ones, as I've moved around -- and the ""line"" is generally nonexistent or one person in front of me at the table where you pick up your ballot.  Maybe two, if it's really busy.  I have to wait longer to buy cookies at the bake sale in the lobby! absentee.  It was heavy this  year and we have to keep pushing it.  That way if some choad cuts EV even further we still get our votes in and counted. That that bald asshole sees these lines and intentionally doesn't want to vote is about as anti-American as anything I've ever seen of heard us.   A clogged toilet has more redeeming qualities than him. I live in Minnesota, I've never waited more than a few minutes to vote. Minneapolis has a population of about 380,000 people, and we have around 130 polling places. And there are plenty of voting booths. Every citizen in this country should have that same right to vote, free from frivolous challenges, free from waiting in long lines. How many voters are assigned to that polling place? Do you live in a highly democratic precinct? How do your local representatives stand for something like that? I'd love to know more about how Florida sets up their elections. If this only happens in Democratic or Minority areas, because far more voters are assigned to the polling places than elsewhere, I wonder if there could be some VRA or HAVA-based legal recourse. I know a lot of states have a maximum cap on how many voters are assigned to a polling place so that DOESN'T happen. And at least where I've lived (not FL), you aren't assigned one. I had a few choices of where to vote early, and my current county allows everyone the choice of which to go to. The entire county worth of voters could theoretically have piled into the one at the county seat on the first day of early voting, and there's nothing but the 'I can't stand in a line that long' factor discouraging later arrivals from staying to prevent exactly that from happening. This system handled 1.4 million voters during early voting this year statewide in TN. I have not been this pissed off in a very long time. It's like we're a fucking third world country. I hope this shame is broadcast all around the world. I voted absentee from the comfort of my dining room table in Cali. If you can find money to kill people, you can find money to help people. --Tony Benn My county elections dept told me if a signature is questioned on a mail in, the person will get a letter and can come in to verify their vote. If there are so many outstanding that it could affect the election, (which there never is), the county would withhold its final numbers. in Florida whose absentee ballot was rejected for that reason.  She was going to court to ask either that it be counted, or that she be allowed to vote in person on Election Day.  (They said, despite the ballot being rejected, that she'd had her shot at voting.) in the running....despite repeated court rejections of his schemes he keeps coming back for new ones.  The latest, announced within the last 24 hours claims that the voter is responsible for listing which ID they used to get to vote and if any of the info is wrong, their vote will be thrown out.... The law actually says election officials are required to verify the ID provided, but Husted doesn't care.  He also fired two election officials in one county who revised to limit early voting hours in the state, and won a court ruling that if someone votes in the wrong district due to having received incorrect information from a voting official (Ohio polling places get moved a lot...especially in Democratic areas) they are SOL as far as having their vote counted. This guy is a REAL piece of work.  I wish the courts would haul him up on charges of criminal interference with voting rights. exposed.. Credit card crap.   People are stupid.  He is young, attractive and people vote based on that,  If he looked like Lurch he wouldn't win but then again look at Scott. I may have to retract my statement. We the People have to make a difference and the Change.....Just do it ! Be part of helping us build a veteran community online. United Veterans of America We dropped the ballots off at the post office across from the cafe and were done.   This is Washington state. The Republicans are playing with fire.   The one thing that makes this country really unique is our committment to universal sufferage.   (The Rs seem committed to universal suffering except for a few.)   This is why even after a debacle like the Gore/Bush election we can have political transitions without violence. Aside from the morality of voting rights for all, it contributes in a large part to our country's stability.    (One civil war is enough.) They'll keep doing it as long as they can get away with it. It's unbelievable that this is acceptable, or allowed. It happens every election. Brought to mind how finally a law was passed that airlines couldn't trap passengers on a parked plane for more than 3 hours without fines kicking in. A strange comparison, I suppose, but there is a point there. Without a federal regulation, the airlines would not/did not care. voter suppression are blatantly unconstitutional per the 14th and perhaps 15th amendments, and I keep getting these lawyers claiming that it's not, I'm wrong, and there's almost nothing we or the feds can do about it. Which, not being a lawyer, I'm not qualified to dispute on technical grounds, but which I still firmly believe is 100% horseshit. Interracial marriage was illegal until 45 years ago, until such laws were found to be unconstitutional. Just because some anal-retentive, passive-aggressive lawyers with the imaginative capacity of a wood borer don't have the stones to take on conventional legal wisdom doesn't mean that we have to accept this nonsense. Everything's impossible until it isn't. Well, not everything, but you know what I mean. ""Liberty without virtue would be no blessing to us"" - Benjamin Rush, 1777 The biggest thing is that voting rules must be applied equally across the population.  Other than that, states have a lot of leeway. This is why Ohio's early voting was successfully challenged by the Obama campaign - they wanted to allow early voting on the three days leading up to the election to only military and their families.  The court said no, you can't do that.  If the SoS were to decide that no one gets to vote in person early, then the Feds can't stop that.  Same with Florida.  Everyone gets the same chances at voting early.  If this were unconstitutional, you'd better believe that the Obama campaign would have already been all over it. (Not a lawyer, if any lawyers find fault with this, feel free to correct! But this is what I've seen.) As an American citizen who has voted in every election since 1980 but whose Presidential vote has never counted once (I live in Oklahoma and the state has gone Republican for President in every election since 1968) I want to thank you for waiting in line 9 hours to vote.  You just voted where I could not, for 9 hours, in order to vote in a place where it counts.  THANK YOU. I had every intention of voting earlier but ended up in the hospital two weeks ago and put on life support in ICU for a week from a COPD exacerbation. If I would have had to have faced those lines after being so so sick, no way would I have been able to have waited that long. This breaks my heart that our people have been put through this. At least my story does have a happy ending...I quit smoking after being a 2 pk a day smoker for 40 years. Not even wanted a cigarette in over two weeks now. COPD put me in the hospital last year (but not ICU, fortunately). I had to get supplemental oxygen again for a few weeks last winter. And yet, I have struggled to quit smoking, and the guilt (and fear) is enormous. I've had clean stints (2 weeks max), but haven't been able to sustain them. I have to quit. I don't want emphysema. Tobacco addiction is evil. completely knocked out those first few days of withdrawal when the breathing tube was in. I know it sounds weird but you are in a very relaxed state through the worse part of the withdrawal so when I finally woke up and the tube was out and the worse of the actual physical withdrawal was over and from that point on it was me and the cigarette fighting the battle. I really didn't have any choice but to quit. Let me tell you though, I fell like a new person already...not completely healed but so much better. I can do so much more already than I could months before I landed in ICU. The docs told hubby I was just a just a very short time from death by the time they got me intubated. I feel like I was given a second chance to enjoy life. Now i am in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and will be taking respiratory therapy also as soon as I see my pulmonologist to get everything set up in early Dec.. So THANKFUL for good insurance. HEalth care for everyone!!!!!! This is what happens when people don't vote. In 2010 when most Floridians stayed home, they gave Rick Scott a license to destroy Florida. Here in NC, we experienced the same thing in 2010. Nobody came out to vote and the Republicans took over the NC House and Senate. They are poised to win the Governorship on Tue. and we will be in trouble in 2014, 2016 and beyond. If we win on Tuesday, I hope Democrats will really feel empowered. When we are empowered, we can accomplish so many things. Unless you include the time it took me to research and make a choice on those infernally long and complex ballot initiatives we had in Seattle...in the comfort of my home or a local cafe, after which I walked my ballot in or dropped it off in a collection box, which once I arrived took all of 2 minutes. This is surreal. This is rediculous. This is infuriating. This is insulting. What this is not is democracy as it should or is meant to be. And will someday be, once these racist troglodytes are finally extinct. It will happen. ""Liberty without virtue would be no blessing to us"" - Benjamin Rush, 1777 Line was only slightly shorter. I got there at 3:45 - didn't get my ballot until 6:30. While walking out at 6:45 (polls close at 7pm) there was still a long line - no way everyone got in to vote. Important side note - part of the reason for the wait were 11 constitutional amendments on the ballot, all of which were crap. these were purposefully added by the Republican legislature to slow down early voting, I'm convinced. I saw some older residents reading the entire ballot, must've taken them 30 min to fill it out. It took me 15 min and I already knew exactly how I was voting CA has been democratic at the state level since the Latinos got up and roared at Pete Wilson (Gov-R) who attempted racist anti-immigration legislation.  In 2010, not a single R was elected to any statewide office. And in this state, registering is a click at a website. If registered, an absentee ballot is a click at a website.  The Ballot arrives a few days later.   It can be mailed, or dropped off for free at multiple locations fairly close to the residence of the voter. For those who lack the web, there are the usual paper-oriented methods, again easily available in multiple locations. In our state, we want people to vote. I feel for people in states that only want the ""right"" people to vote (no pun intended).  If you break the logjam, ever, and get some statewide power, get your people to pass legislation reversing the suppression tide. Aventura is in north Dade county. Despite the vociferous Cuban population here, Miami is heavily Democratic.  North Dade is home to a very large portion of the county's black residents, and Aventura is the nearest EV location for many of them. Encouraging to see so many out here, but discouraging to know that many were not able to vote the day I was there. Amador County California has a Democratic registration of 32%, and a Republican registration of 46%, and the further right AI party has 4% registration. In the 2012 primaries, 36% of the ballots cast were by Democrats, 50% by Republicans, and 4% by the AI party. Gee, I wonder why you never had to wait more than 5 minutes to vote? Could it be that the Amador County powers that be are also Republican, and they just happen to want to make it nice and easy for their Republican voters to cast their Republican votes? robably true a few years back, however, I believe the Democratic registrations have increased over the past few years. I can tell you that the Registrar of Voters in this county and the Elections Department are totally non-partisan. I helped to certify the voting machines in the Nov. 2006 election and there were Republicans and Democrats overseeing the process from beginning to end. So in spite of the fact that there are more registered Republicans than Democrats in this county, what you suggest about voting times is complete bullshit. As for the ""powers that be"", I can tell you that based on working with Sheldon Johnson the Clerk/Recorder/Registrar of Voters you couldn't find a better more impartial person running things. Sheldon has been in office for 34 years and has done a fantastic job over the years in elections and in the Clerk/Recorder's office. Sadly, he will be retiring at the end of December. Finally, I've lived here for over 20 years and I wouldn't hesitate to vouch for the fairness of the Elections Department. He has no doubt done a fine job and now gets to enjoy his well earned retirement. Would only that the voters of Florida and Ohio had such a man to ensure that they would not have to wait in lines for up to 10 hours to vote. If only Mr. Johnson could have been there to stop the higher ranking Republican powers that be from disenfranchising voters in Democratic majority areas. I am sitting here at the opposite corner of the country, crying for our democracy. I don't give a damn what party you belong to, who you are trying to vote in or out, or what crazy beliefs you might have about taxes, labor laws, abortion, or anything else. This is just FLAT. OUT. WRONG. ""These are not candidates. These are the empty stand-ins for lobbyists' policies to be legislated later."" - Chimpy, 9/24/10 I live in a predominantly white area, and I have never waited for more than about 45 minutes to vote. I only waited about 15 minutes this time. Yet folks in predominantly black areas have always posted 3+hour waiting times. It's complete BS. Time is of no account with great thoughts, which are as fresh to-day as when they first passed through their authors' minds ages ago. - Samuel Smiles Over the next two years FL Dems should hammer Scott and the GOP over this, and promise to fix this if Floridian return Dens to power. Crist has a good tack record on this and he should emphasize this as a major issue. Coming Soon -- to an Internet connection near you: Armisticeproject.org If white, suburban voters had to go through this to cast a vote, the voting laws would change overnight.  It should be a priority that voters should wait no longer than 30 minutes to vote (like those in the 'burbs).  The early voting lines in my county in Maryland routinely had 1.5 to 2.5 hr waits all day long.  That is ridiculous to put people through even a two hour wait to cast a vote. I know a handful of states are really moving forward alternatives (mail in ballots), I wish the others would follow. ""When a nation goes down, or a society perishes, one condition may always be found; they forgot where they came from. They lost sight of what had brought them along."" --Carl Sandburg if only Democrats had turned out like this two years ago, we wouldn't have these long lines and the rest of Scott's voter supression to fight against. This is what happens when we only vote in Presidential years (and, as in 2008, only vote for President leave the downballot blank)....a lot of people don't realize that the federal government has a very limited role in regulating elections, it's the state and local officials who decide how easy it will be for you to vote. Five minutes was the wait time to get my ballot.  Photo I.D. not asked for.  45 seconds to fill out one ballot wrong, have the receptacle spit it out as such, another 3 minutes to receive another ballot and finish voting. Of course the down side was the number of local offices with only one person running.  I spent more time researching the County Forest Preserve Board choices because of that. Florida's mess is the result of stupidly electing an unknown CEO who doesn't give a shit about reelection. Huge tax giveaways and destroying union jobs is why Scott is there as weel as profiteering. Don Siegelman is wasting away in a Louisiana slammer for nothing while Rick Scott requires drug testing that enriches his spouse's businesses. being in Florida and knowing this year was under Scott, I voted absentee but had the satisfaction of turning it in in person.  No problem other than questioning things and making sure the vote got counted. We the People have to make a difference and the Change.....Just do it ! Be part of helping us build a veteran community online. United Veterans of America I know exactly where you voted (we spend about a month a year in Sunny Isles), and there is ZERO excuse for there being any kind of wait.  Up here in Mass, I wait 10 minutes - MAX - and am usually in and out in less than 5. Why on earth is this tolerated? Congrats on voting.  Which seems like a very odd and unacceptable thing to say.  It just shouldn't be an ordeal. we simply don't have queues to vote in the UK.  You just go in, collect your ballot paper, go into the plywood booth, mark it with a pencil (on a string, in the booth), then come out and drop it in the box. I've never seen more than a couple of people waiting for a spare booth. When 37 polling sites in Miami-Dade and Broward counties opened at 7 a.m. on the last day of early voting, two had five-hour waits. The wait was four hours or longer at three other sites. And the waits only got longer. Voters in line by the time closed at 7 p.m. were allowed to vote. At 6:42 p.m., the Miami-Dade elections department estimated that a half a dozen sites had six-hour lines. On Friday, the Miami-Dade voters had stayed open until 11 p.m. At least one person left without voting due to the long line: At the West Dade Regional Library, 59-year-old Rolando Gutierrez, who was next-to-last in line at around 2 p.m., told the woman behind him, 45-year-old Maria Corro, that he was thinking of leaving to avoid the three- or four-hour wait. ""Maybe it will be less,"" said Corro, a nurse who had been dropped off by her husband. She had brought along her 11-year-old daughter, Sofia, who sat on a bench doing homework. ""You have to think positive."" But a few minutes later, Gutierrez walked away. ""I don't have a choice,"" said Gutierrez, who works the night shift loading trucks for UPS. ""I have to sleep."" He said he plans to go to his precinct on Tuesday, to vote for Obama, whom he voted for four years ago. But despite Rick Scott's voter suppression efforts, there's this: As of Friday, Democrats led Republicans by about 187,000 in early, in-person voting . Republicans led Democrats by 84,000 in absentee ballots cast. That's an overall advantage for Dems of 103,000 votes as of Friday.  Obama defeated McCain by 200,000 votes in 2008. I'm just saying. I'm probably still in my little dream world (swore I picked up an hour there somewhere), but there should be some sort of federal directive, immediately after this election, that takes all this bullshit out of the voting process. I get antsy waiting five minutes for a pizza, I could not imagine. I've done it by mail mostly the past few years, although I did head down last year for a local vote on school issues. Not a problem here in TinyTown, Vermont. Head down to where they store the snowplow, nudge awake the town clerk, and vote. Ridiculously easy, which should be the motto of my dream directive: Voting: It's Ridiculously Easy I swear, in many areas of this country, it sounds like you're suiting up to search for the fucking grail whenever you go to cast a vote. Fixing this should be high on Reid and Speaker Pelosi's list come January (hey, it's my dream world, I'm throwing the House our way too, hehe). with folks in poor health or the older population standing in line for so long to exercise their right to elect the leader of our country. Of course the Governor and his ilk have no shame. Power is their drug. I guess Hell's just the place for ""kiss ass politicians"" who pander to assholes. Take note Florida's Rick Scot, of how a state that cares about America and democracy reacts! Voters in New Jersey now have two more ways to send in their ballots in an already unusual election season complicated by superstorm Sandy: via fax and email. http://online.wsj.com/... . Also in an effort to protect democracy and insure that all of our citizens' voices will be heard, ""People will also be able to vote somewhere other than the county in which they are registered, the administration said."" Yes, I am worried about voting machines in Ohio, and long lines in Florida, and Project ORCA poll watchers tying to mislead and intimidate voters in Iowa, and misinformation in Colorado, anonymous billboards in Wisconsin, and, and, and ................. but am glad to know that in New Jersey at least,  even a hurricane can't stop  the vote. ""The elective franchise, if guarded as the ark of our safety, will peaceably dissipate all combinations to subvert a Constitution, dictated by the wisdom, and resting on the will of the people. "" Thomas Jefferson the waiting time is so long.  I've worked in the polls in Michigan for over a decade, so I  don't have to stand in line anymore (which frankly I miss) as I now vote AV.  But being a poll worker, I can say that our wait time might be no more than an hour.  What's going on in these polling precincts that creates such a long wait?  Not enough poll workers, not enough booths, super-long ballots, just an overwhelming number of people wanting to vote early?  It's outrageous that people have to wait the equivalent of a work day to vote!  Any politician who has a hand in this (at best) inefficient or (at worst) suppressive practice should be held accountable when they come up for re-election.  Trust me, Michigan has had our own issues with our Secretary of State and I'm going to be working hard to see she's not re-elected.  Stills999, thanks for sticking it out and casting your vote! ""People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power."" - Bill Clinton, August 2008 On October 26th, I e-mailed a request for an absentee ballot to my county elections supervisor.  They return messaged me that my request was being processed and I could expect my ballot in 2-3 days. By yesterday, November 3rd, at 6:00 PM, I still had no ballot, and so I e-mailed an urgent notice to the elections supervisor advising her of my plight. As a number of you know, I live in rural South Dade in the area where your winter veggies and tomatoes come from.  My mailbox is a rural route cluster installation three miles away from my house.  On Saturday, we don't go get the mail  if no one has had to go ""into town"" that day -- trying to be green. Fortunately, LimeSpouse had to make a milk run (He must have his milk and ice cream bedtime float each and every night w/o fail!) and remembered to pick up the mail on the way back.  There was my ballot.  It was post marked ""November 2nd""!  Not the 2-3 days after my request, as promised. I promptly filled it out, made sure my signature in the red box on the outside of the envelope appears exactly as my name is printed on my Voter ID.  It awaits delivery later today into the overnight post office box at our substation (10 miles away). Wouldn't want to cut it any closer! Of course I voted for President Obama, Senator Bill Nelson, and Joe Garcia. What did you think? I almost sent my wife to that voting place for early voting but she will vote on Tuesday.  I voted absentee and received my email today that my vote has been received.  I voted for Obama of course and every other Democrat.  I voted ""no"" on every amendment and yes to retain every judge (that is the democratic party position FYI). This is my first voting in Florida after living in Manhattan. My wife got her citizenship and voter registration just last month and is a first time voter.  I am so happy at the strength of the vote of my wife and I.  Two new democratic party Florida votes in 2012!! but in Michigan you have to have one of the following reasons in order to vote by mail: -age 60 years old or older -unable to vote without assistance at the polls -expecting to be out of town on election day -in jail awaiting arraignment or trial -unable to attend the polls due to religious reasons -appointed to work as an election inspector in a precinct outside of your precinct of residence. (I use this one) I know a couple of people (and I'm sure there are A LOT more) who get absentee ballots even though they don't meet any of the requirements.  They just say they're going to be out of town.  I'm bound and determined to change this in Michigan so that ANYONE can get an AV ballot and I also want Michigan to go the early voting route as well.  The states are all over the place when it comes to early voting, AV ballots, etc.  Do you  have differences from province to province like we do from state to state?  Or do they all follow the same policies/procedures? ""People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power."" - Bill Clinton, August 2008 I should note that, at least in Chicago, mail-in absentee ballots are opened and counted after election night, along with provisional ballots. So you are sort of treated as a second-class voter, in that you don't get counted on election night. That's crazy!  Our AV ballots are counted throughout the day and are included in the night's totals.  The more I hear about what's going on from state to state, the madder I'm getting that we don't have some kind of standard across the country for national elections.  This is nuts... ""People the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power."" - Bill Clinton, August 2008 But people have different reasons why they want to vote in person, and to vote on election day. I've stood at a lot of precincts as people vote in person (both early and on election day), and I have a sense these are the two general reasons: * Distrust of the mail-in system.  Definitely a legitimate concern.  I've verified with my supervisor of elections that if my signature gets rejected, I would be notified on a timely basis. Even so, I don't feel 100% confident that my vote will count. * Joy of taking part in the timeless tradition of showing up and casting a vote in person. I had read an article (I think its posted somewhere above) that many mail-in ballots have been thrown away due to questionable circumstances such as signatures not being considered as matching.  There were also issues that the envelopes were inconsistent in different counties such as people were signing them incorrectly.  Thus, as a new citizen I wanted to vote in person to be sure as possible my vote counted. Call me crazy, but I have high suspicion, especially inthe current climate, that employers (or others) might demand to review their employees' ballots as a condition of employment, where mail-in voting (and thus lost ballot secrecy) was available. Other nefarious purposes are also available. It may not be a shorter line on election day, additionally many people have work situations that prevent them from voting on election day. For instance a friend of mine lives 40 minutes from her work in a different county, she might be able to get off work in time to vote but does not take the risk of an unforeseen incident keeping her from voting. open more voting centers and booths. Hire more people to do this and we can fix 2 problems with one expenditure: long lines at the voting booth and the unemployment office. What somebody already thought of that? Why didn't they do it?...Well, that's stupid. I am happy to report my wife and I were able to vote about five minutes after the doors to the Oshkosh Convention Center opened on October 22, the first day of early voting. In anticipation of larger than usual turnout, the city fathers moved the Early Voting from City Hall to the Convention Center. We were already registered, so we were sent right through. We received our ballots, filled them out for a solid pile of Democrats, put them into the envelopes, and we were out of there. Gotta stop that!!  We've had early voting here for weeks in Ohio.  I was out canvassing in a predominately black neighborhood and almost everyone said they had already voted, but the Obama campaign had to fight the Republlcian Secretary of State who was trying to stop it! Every November my coworkers and I have to sit through a powerpoint presentation detailing our health insurance options. And every year, we find out how much of an increase we're going to see in our ...

"She dropped it into the flame . For a while , she stood with her back to Henry , leaning on the mantel-piece , and looking into the fire . He took the chair to which she had pointed , with a strange contradiction of expression in his face : the tears were in his eyes , while the brows above were knit close in an angry frown . He muttered to himself , ' Damn him ! ' She rallied her courage , and looked at him again when she spoke . ' Well , Henry , and why are you going away ? ' ' I am out of spirits , Agnes , and I want a change . ' She paused before she spoke again . His face told her plainly that he was thinking of her when he made that reply . She was grateful to him , but her mind was not with him : her mind was still with the man who had deserted her . She turned round again to the fire . ' Is it true , ' she asked , after a long silence , ' that they have been married to-day ? ' He answered ungraciously in the one necessary word : -- ' Yes . ' ' Did you go to the church ? ' He resented the question with an expression of indignant surprise . ' Go to the church ? ' he repeated . ' I would as soon go to -- ' He checked himself there . ' How can you ask ? ' he added in lower tones . ' I have never spoken to Montbarry , I have not even seen him , since he treated you like the scoundrel and the fool that he is . ' She looked at him suddenly , without saying a word . He understood her , and begged her pardon . But he was still angry . ' The reckoning comes to some men , ' he said , ' even in this world . He will live to rue the day when he married that woman ! ' Agnes took a chair by his side , and looked at him with a gentle surprise . ' Is it quite reasonable to be so angry with her , because your brother preferred her to me ? ' she asked . Henry turned on her sharply . ' Do you defend the Countess , of all the people in the world ? ' ' Why not ? ' Agnes answered . ' I know nothing against her . On the only occasion when we met , she appeared to be a singularly timid , nervous person , looking dreadfully ill ; and being indeed so ill that she fainted under the heat of my room . Why should we not do her justice ? We know that she was innocent of any intention to wrong me ; we know that she was not aware of my engagement -- ' Henry lifted his hand impatiently , and stopped her .

"Anderson Silva cageside for UFC 154 with super-fight against Georges St. Pierre on mind Brazilian fighter Anderson Silva will be in Montreal Nov. 17 to cheer on Canada's Georges St. Pierre in his welterweight title unification bout against Carlos Condit. Why? Because Silva, the UFC middleweight kingpin, would love to fight GSP himself. (AFP) Though St. Pierre is scheduled to unify the welterweight straps with Condit in the main event of UFC 154 in Montreal on Nov. 17, he can't seem to shake the spectre of a potential super-fight with Silva. UFC president Dana White threw fuel on the fire months ago, saying the bout could happen if St. Pierre defeats Condit. The Brazilian has also been openly vocal in his desire to make the showdown a reality. Should St. Pierre be victorious at the Bell Centre, White said he wouldn't be shocked if Silva challenges the Montreal native in the octagon. ""There's no doubt that Anderson Silva is showing up to cheer Georges St. Pierre on,"" White said on a media call Wednesday. ""He wants him to win this fight and he wants to fight him after. So I would say, yes."" Though MMA fans may be thrilled by Silva's intentions, St. Pierre is hardly concerned about the middleweight kingpin's cage-side appearance. ""I don't care about Anderson Silva,"" St. Pierre said bluntly. ""He can do whatever he wants. He can go to Florida, or stay in Brazil if he wants. I'm focusing on Carlos Condit. That's all that matters to me. ""The fight I want the most right now is against the best man right now -- Carlos Condit. That's the fight I want."" The UFC's top pay-per-view draw, St. Pierre hasn't competed since winning a lacklustre unanimous decision over Jake Shields 19 months ago. Though a bout with Silva would mean big business for the UFC, White feels fans would be crazy to underestimate Condit. However, should it become a reality, he said he has three possible stadiums in mind, including the Rogers Centre. ""There are three great venues that you'd do,"" White began. ""We could go to Toronto, huge stadium there, Dallas Cowboys Stadium or you could do a soccer stadium in Brazil. So those are our three options. ""It's fun to talk about this super-fight, but I'm sure it's pissing Carlos off every time. (St. Pierre) has to get through Carlos Condit first. ""I really believe a lot of people aren't giving this kid enough credit. He's tough, man. This kid can fight. He's got great ground skills and he's got knockout power. If you look at the fights normally done in boxing, when a champion of GSP's calibre comes back, they usually give him an easy fight. This is far from an easy fight for Georges St. Pierre. This is a very tough fight."" As far as Condit is concerned, fans can get as excited as they want over the potential super-fight. It doesn't change the fact that it will be him standing across from St. Pierre in less than two weeks. This also isn't the first time he's been thrust into the role of spoiler. He stopped B.C.'s Rory MacDonald in Vancouver, knocked out England's Dan Hardy in London and squashed a potential bout between St. Pierre and Nick Diaz. Condit said he likes being the underdog. ""I would say that it's definitely motivating,"" Condit began. ""I like playing the role of the spoiler. There are a lot of people in this sport and in the media that are overlooking me as an opponent for Georges. Maybe they're looking forward to a super-fight with Anderson. ""They're two of the greatest fighters ever to step into the octagon and there's always that interest in seeing who is really the best. But first things first, Georges and I have to do our thing."" Though Condit feels some are underestimating his chances, he doesn't lump St. Pierre in with that crowd. ""I don't feel like Georges is overlooking me,"" Condit said. ""I'm excited to get in there, do my thing and hopefully change a lot of plans ... I'm going to walk away with the UFC welterweight title. Undisputed -- no more interim championship. I'm going to be the undisputed champion. ""I pose a lot of problems for opponents, not just Georges, that they don't get from different guys. I'm well-rounded and able to take the fight to my opponent, no matter where the fight ends up."" ",4,4
"Victor Englebert / Photo Researchers Like hiking ? Then come and explore the plants and animals of seven of the world's major mountain ranges ! From the towering Himalayas to the austere Atlas Mountains , mountain ecosystems are chock full of interesting organisms . Often considered biological hotspots , many of these regions feature life forms with amazing adaptations to enable survival in rugged terrain and extreme weather conditions . Learn more about montane flora and fauna with this quick tour through a variety of mountains across the globe . Great Dividing Range Ron Dorman – Bruce Coleman Inc. A hike along Australia's Great Dividing Range would reveal a series of plateaus and low mountain ranges roughly paralleling the coasts of Queensland , New South Wales , and Victoria . The mountain range extends some 2,300 miles ( 3 , 700 km ) from the Cape York Peninsula , Queensland , to the Grampians in Victoria Bass Strait between Australia and Tasmania . In Queensland , the mountains average is 2,000 – 3 , 000 feet ( 600 – 900 meters ) in elevation , but they rise as high as 5,000 feet ( 1 , 500 meters ) in the Bellenden Ker and McPherson ranges and the Lamington Plateau . Farther south , a segment known as the Australian Alps , near the New South Wales – Victoria border , contains Australia's highest peak , Mount Kosciuszko ( 7 , 310 feet ) . Since the Great Dividing Range is not very high compared to other mountain ranges , few animals specifically adapted to mountainous environments occur there . Tree kangaroos and bird-wing butterflies occur in the rainforests of the mountainous northeast . Some bird species , such as the galah and the Australian magpie are found throughout Australia . Much of the Great Dividing Range is defined by forested areas of acacias , eucalyptus ( see photo ) , and casuarinas , with hummock grasses and flowering plants , including banksias , in the undergrowth . The vegetation on the western slopes is predominately subtropical or temperate woodlands of eucalyptus and scrub . The Wollemi pine is a "" living fossil "" that was discovered in Wollemi National Park in 1994 . Ethiopian Highlands Although Ethiopia's complex relief defies easy classification , of the five topographic regions in the country only two ( the Western Highlands and the Eastern Highlands ) might be classified as mountain ecosystems . The most spectacular portion is the North Central massifs in the Western Highlands ; these form the roof of Ethiopia , the highest being Mount Ras Dejen at 14,872 feet ( 4 , 533 meters ) . Lake Tana ( see photo ) – Ethiopia's largest inland lake and the main reservoir for the Blue Nile River – is located in this region , at an elevation of about 6,000 feet ( 1 , 800 meters ) . Another region , the Western Lowlands , are not what one would call low . They stretch north-south along the border with Sudan and South Sudan and include the lower valleys of the Blue Nile , Tekeze , and Baro rivers . With elevations of about 3,300 feet ( 1 , 000 meters ) , these "" lowlands "" are some of the hottest places on the planet . Several familiar African mammals live in Ethiopia , such as lions , leopards , elephants , giraffes , rhinoceroses , and wild buffalo , but these species rarely venture into the mountains . Uniquely Ethiopian mountain-dwelling species include the walia ibex of the Simien Mountains , the mountain nyala ( a kind of antelope ) , the Simien jackal , and the gelada monkey . These creatures are endangered , and they appear in both the Western and Eastern highlands in numbers ranging from a few hundred for the walia ibex to a few thousand for the others . The primary vegetation types of the Ethiopian Highlands are moorland , grassland , and herb meadow . While much of the region is predominantly grass and heathland , a number of other plants are also characteristic . Punctuating the landscape is the lovely Rosa abyssinica , an endemic rose bush that towers up to 6.5 feet ( 2 meters ) high . The kosso tree is used in traditional medicine as a vermifuge , and the wild African olive tree is found in many places throughout the range . One of the most unusual species is the giant lobelia , which reaches a height of 20 feet ( 6 meters ) when flowering . Himalayas Steven Powers / The Wildlife Collection For thousands of years the Himalayas have held a profound significance for the peoples of South Asia , as their literature , mythologies , and religions reflect . Since ancient times the vast glaciated heights have attracted the attention of the pilgrim mountaineers of India , who coined the Sanskrit name Himalaya – from hima ( "" snow "" ) and alaya ( "" abode "" ) – for this great mountain system . In contemporary times the Himalayas have offered the greatest attraction and the greatest challenge to mountaineers throughout the world . The Himalayas have more than 110 peaks rising to elevations of 24,000 feet ( 7 , 300 meters ) or more above sea level , including Kanchenjunga at the border of India ( Sikkim state ) and Nepal ( see photo ) . One of these peaks is Mount Everest ( Tibetan : Chomolungma ; Chinese : Qomolangma Feng ; Nepali : Sagarmatha ) , the world's highest , with an elevation of 29,035 feet ( 8 , 850 meters ) . The fauna of the eastern Himalayas is similar to that of the southern Chinese and Southeast Asian region . The animal life of the western Himalayas , however , have more in common with the Mediterranean , Ethiopian , and Turkmenian regions . Elephants and rhinoceroses are restricted to parts of the forested Tarai region – moist or marshy areas , now largely drained – at the base of the low hills in southern Nepal . Asiatic black bears , clouded leopards , langurs ( a long-tailed Asian monkey ) , and Himalayan goat antelopes ( e.g. , the tahr ) are some of the denizens of the Himalayan forests . In the foothills one may find the Indian rhinoceros , musk deer , and the Kashmir stag ( hangul ) , but in small numbers . In remote sections of the Himalayas , at higher elevations , snow leopards , brown bears , lesser pandas , and Tibetan yaks have limited populations . Above the tree line the most numerous animals , however , are diverse types of insects , spiders , and mites , which are the only animal forms that can live as high up as 20,700 feet ( 6 , 300 meters ) . The Himalayas are rich in floral biodiversity . On the western side of the range , the lower shrublands are defined by beautiful rhododendrons and meadows of grasses . In the eastern region , broadleaf forests receive almost 80 inches ( 200 centimeters ) of annual rainfall and feature indigenous oaks and maples with orchids and ferns in the understory . As one ascends the mountains , the temperate sub-alpine conifer forests dominate the landscape with pine , hemlock , spruce , and fir . The Himalayan balsam and other small , flowering plants can be found above the treeline in the alpine regions . Atlas Mountains Tom McHugh / Photo Researchers The Atlas system is a series of mountain ranges in northwestern Africa that run generally southwest to northeast across Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia . They extend for more than 1,200 miles ( 2 , 000 kilometers ) from the Moroccan port of Agadir in the southwest to the Tunisian capital of Tunis in the northeast . Mount Toubkal at 13,665 feet ( 4 , 165 meters ) is the highest point in the Atlas Mountains . Other imposing peaks in the Atlas include Mount Tidirhine at 8,058 feet ( 2 , 456 meters ) , the rugged bastion of the Ouarsenis Massif ( which reaches a height of 6,512 feet ) , the Great Kabylie , which reaches 7,572 feet ( 2 , 308 meters ) at the peak of Lalla Khedidja , and Mount Chelia ( 7 , 638 feet ) . Much of the land in the Atlas has been cleared for agriculture , and a small fraction of the forest cover remains . Animal life in the mountains is also in retreat . There remain only a few jackals , a few tribes of monkeys ( Barbary macaques , the only African ape found north of the Sahara ) at higher elevations , and occasional herds of wild boars in the oak woods – found in the northern part of the range . With low rainfall and high rates of soil erosion , the Atlas Mountains are fairly sparsely vegetated . The areas with the highest rainfall feature moist forests of cork oaks with an undergrowth of arbutus ( cane apple ) and heather shrubs dotted with carpets of rockroses and lavender . Dry regions are populated with green oak and arborvitae ( a species of pine tree ) which form light , dry forests with a thin and bushy undergrowth . Stands of cedar dominate the higher altitudes , though the dry summits are often reduced to scattered stands of green oak and juniper trees . 1 Rocky Mountains Donnie Sexton / Travel Montana The Rocky Mountains are a massive cordillera made up of more than 100 separate mountain ranges stretching from Alberta and British Columbia to New Mexico . The spectacular vistas of the Rockies , such as St. Mary's Lake in Montana's Glacier National Park ( see photo ) , have inspired countless mountain climbers , explorers , and even songwriters ; John Denver wrote his famous anthem "" Rocky Mountain High "" about these uplands in 1972 . Among the large mammals emblematic of the rugged backcountry are the black bear , grizzly bear , mountain lion , and wolverine . Bighorn sheep and mountain goats inhabit the high crags in summer and migrate to the lower slopes for the winter months . Members of the deer family , such as the caribou , elk ( wapiti ) , mule deer , and white-tailed deer also migrate between alpine meadows and subalpine forests ; the solitary moose lumbers across northern lakes , streams , and marshy areas , feeding on willow foliage and aquatic plants . Wolves , brought to near extinction by human predation , remain rare but have resurged since 1970 as their importance in the wilderness ecosystem has come to be appreciated . Smaller mammals of the lower elevations include the least chipmunk , red squirrel , Columbian ground squirrel , black-footed ferret , and marmot . Far below the tree line , one can walk amongst beautiful forests dominated by ponderosa pines and quaking aspen . Ascend a bit higher and the forests change to subalpine spruces and firs that get progressively more gnarled and stunted with the increase in elevation . Above the tree line , one will find alpine meadows of small , herbaceous plants that are hardier than their appearance would have you believe . These include blue columbine , snow buttercup , and pink phlox .",1,1
"Today, we're going to talk about removing another kind of filler from your speech (and your writing as well): empty words. Just like empty calories have the form of food but offer no nourishment to the eater, empty words take the form of verbiage, but offer no substance to the listener -- leaving them hungry for meaning and details. While ""uh's"" and ""um's"" can be eliminated altogether, empty words need to be replaced with heartier fare. Stocking your cupboard with such means building a large and varied vocabulary. It seems like the only people who think about building their vocabulary are young adults who are preparing for standardized tests. Which is a shame, as expanding our vocabularies should be a lifelong pursuit. Why so? Because a command of words can benefit your life in many ways. The Benefits of Building Your Vocabulary Gives you the ability to say what you mean. Is your speech filled more with emotion than meaning ? Is everything either ""stupid"" or ""awesome?"" The overuse of a word to describe a wide range of seemingly unrelated things saps it of any meaning. If a corn dog, a YouTube video, a job promotion, and the Great Wall of China are all ""awesome,"" then awesome ceases to have any meaning at all. Think of your vocabulary like the dial on an amp -- if it's always turned up to 11, you don't have anywhere to go when trying to describe something truly impressive. Your only resort is to add empty intensifiers: ""But seriously , it was really awesome."" The less you use what should be a meaningful word, the more potent it becomes (this goes for swear words too, by the way). Conversely, a nimble working vocabulary gives you the ability to make finer and finer distinctions between things so that you can say exactly what you mean, and be explicit instead of vague when sharing your ideas and opinions or simply making conversation. This increases your chances of having other people understand what you wish to express, and at the same time it... Helps you understand other people. Building your vocabulary involves more than just memorizing lists of the kinds of words you had to know for the SAT. Just as learning a second language can help you understand people from other countries, increasing your working vocabulary allows you to understand those who may share your mother tongue but also have a special ""dialect"" of their own. People's fields of work and interests often come with special terminology that isn't as commonly known. The more of these ""special"" words you learn, the greater the variety of people you can connect with. Not only does a diverse vocabulary allow you to build rapport with a wide range of people, but knowing some medical, legal, and other technical/professional lingo can prevent you from being taken advantage of, and allow you to be proactive in your approach to dealing with doctors, lawyers, mechanics, customer service, and so on. Helps you understand what you read. Vocabulary not only aids you in understanding other people, it's also essential in comprehending the books and articles you read. Words you're unfamiliar with become little holes in the text, preventing you from reaching a complete understanding of what you're reading. Assists you in becoming a more informed and involved citizen. Related to the two points above, the more you increase your vocabulary in general, and also specifically in areas like politics, geography, the military, and so on, the better able you become to understand news and currents events, and the more widely varied the conversations, discussions, and debates you can jump into. And when you do take part in a debate, you'll be able to use -- gasp! -- facts, instead of heated bloviations. Bolsters your ability to grasp ideas and think more logically and incisively. While we often think of our thoughts as shaping our words, it works the other way around as well. Think of words like a set of tools -- a small vocabulary is like trying to carve a sculpture with only a chainsaw, versus using a whole set of different instruments that can make both broad and fine cuts. The greater the number of words at your disposal, the more instruments you have with which to hone your own ideas, and dissect and examine those of others. Allows you to communicate effectively. A masterful command of words, and the ability to select just the right ones to express a specific idea, for a particular audience (more on this below), is essential in crafting powerful and engaging speech and writing. The repetition of the same words over and over again quickly bores people, while the skilled use of a wide array of them enables you to draw people in and paint a rich picture. This is why an expansive vocabulary is one of the keys for great leaders -- words allow you to grab the interest, and then allegiance, of others. And a robust vocabulary is just as important when you're operating off the cuff as when your remarks are pre-planned -- instead of hemming and hawing, searching for the right words to say, you can express yourself forcefully and with confidence. Boosts your powers of persuasion. It's hard to get people interested in an idea -- whether a tangible product, a business pitch, or a piece of philosophy -- and convince them of it unless you 1) understand it inside and out yourself, and 2) can describe it to others in an engaging way (see the two points above). Repeating the same word over and over again (""I've got this cool idea. See, it's got this cool wheel here and then this really cool axle stick outs..."") is going to have the eyes of your audience quickly glazing over. It certainly won't help you sell them on something, or on yourself -- issuing banalities in a job interview (""I'm a hard worker and a people person!"") won't do anything to set you apart from the myriad of other hard working, people-pleasing candidates. Helps you make a good impression on others . How articulate you are constitutes a big part of the impression you make on others. Based on the vocabulary you use, people will make judgments about your socioeconomic background, education, occupation, and the stimulation and demands of your everyday life (a stay-at-home mom sometimes starts using baby language when talking with adults, while a professor may drop very academic terms into casual conversation). It's not a particularly unfair judgment to make. Your schooling, circle of friends, job, and reading habits do have a direct and considerable effect on your vocabulary. But that doesn't mean that if you're a construction worker or don't have many years of schooling, that a sizable vocabulary is out of reach. Building your vocabulary is a very egalitarian pursuit: anybody can do it, and can start anytime. Malcolm X serves as a great example of this, and many of the above points as well. His formal education ended in junior high, and as a young man he fell into a life of crime and was eventually arrested and put in prison for burglary. As he recalled in his autobiography , behind bars X (then named Malcolm Little), came under the mentorship of a fellow prisoner, whose self-education Little envied, and who motivated him to get some ""homemade education"" for himself. Little was particularly frustrated that he was unable ""to express what I wanted to convey in letters that I wrote...In the street, I had been the most articulate hustler out there -- I had commanded attention when I said something. But now, trying to write simple English, I not only wasn't articulate, I wasn't even functional."" Little was also vexed by his difficulty in reading: ""Every book I picked up had few sentences which didn't contain anywhere from one to nearly all of the words that might as well have been in Chinese. When I just skipped those words, of course, I really ended up with little idea of what the book said."" He was motivated to turn this around for himself, and so requested some tablets, pencils, and a dictionary from the prison. After rifling through the dictionary's countless pages, amazed at the number of words he didn't know and confused about which he needed to learn, Little turned to the first page of entries and started slowly and painstakingly copying each and every one of them by hand, ""down to the punctuation marks."" It took him a whole day to inscribe one page, after which he read the words back to himself over and over again. Malcolm woke up the next morning ""thinking about those words -- immensely proud to realize that not only had I written so much at one time, but I'd writ-ten words that I never knew were in the world. Moreover, with a little effort, I also could remember what many of these words meant. I reviewed the words whose meanings I didn't remember."" He repeated the same process over and over again, going page by page through the dictionary copying every single word, until finally he had copied the entire tome. This exercise did not take long to bear the prisoner rich fruits: ""I suppose it was inevitable that as my word-base broadened, I could for the first time pick up a book and read and now begin to understand what the book was saying. Anyone who has read a great deal can imagine the new world that opened."" Little became a voracious reader, devouring every book the prison library had to offer. Once he had served out his sentence, his vocabulary studies transformed him into an articulate speaker, known for his incisive rhetoric. Even those who didn't agree with what he had to say were impressed with how he said it. As he himself recalled, ""Many who today hear me somewhere in person, or on television, or those who read something I've said, will think I went to school far beyond the eighth grade. This impression is due entirely to my prison studies."" The good news here is not only that anyone who has the discipline and motivation to build their vocabulary can succeed, but there's a much easier way of doing it than copying down the entire dictionary! The 5 Easy Steps to Building Your Vocabulary There are a lot of good strategies for building your vocabulary -- learning the meaning of suffixes, prefixes, and roots of words, going through word lists and making flash cards for the words you don't know, and signing up for a daily ""Word of the Day"" email from a website like Merriam-Webster.com, to name a few. But since I personally find it hard to motivate myself to study etymology, considered my flash card days over when I left law school, and know I wouldn't open my Word of the Day email consistently (despite a pang of guilt each time), let me share my favorite vocabulary-building method. It's a simple and classic one that helps you build your vocabulary gradually and naturally -- without too much extra exertion. While it's been around a long time, I first discovered it through one of those old cheesy, but wise, instructional films that I love: Here's how it works: The slow but earnest Mr. Willis tries to advocate for the building of a park, but has trouble expressing himself. In fact, the lady on the left was heard to mutter, ""Whatcha talkin' about Willis?"" 1. Read. Reading is the single biggest thing you can do to increase your vocabulary (and of course it offers a whole host of other benefits as well). Without specifically trying to study vocabulary, you encounter tons of new words, the meaning of which you can often glean from the context in which the word is situated (although you shouldn't rely exclusively on context -- see below). Reading offers not just an awareness of words, but a real feel for them. Mr. Willis takes up reading to boost his vocabulary -- checking out books on everything from home decorating to his printing business. The broader and more challenging your reading selections, the beefier your working vocabulary will become. Strive to read both nonfiction and fiction. Instead of only browsing content-aggregator sites, read entire articles in high-caliber newspaper like The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal , and magazines like The Atlantic . Also dip into periodicals on different kinds of subjects like The Smithsonian or Scientific American. 2. Listen. You can also pick up new words from the people you talk with and listen to. This is, after all, exactly how you learned words back when you were a toddler. Our son Gus is always picking up new words from things we say, trying to figure out the context, and then trying them out himself (it's excellent motivation to curb your cursing!). Sometimes he gets it right, sometimes he gets it wrong -- often to comedic effect. Of course, the effectiveness of this listen-to-learn method depends on who you surround yourself with. Challenge yourself by associating with well-educated people, watching interesting lectures, and taking the harder classes in school, even if doing so makes you uncomfortable. Iron sharpens iron, and the vocabulary of those with keens minds will rub off on you. Mr. Willis begins to jot down words he hears and reads that he doesn't know the meaning of. 3. Write down words you read and hear that you don't know. Reading and listening are the ways you expose yourself to new words. Once someone uses a word you're unfamiliar with, or you come across a new word while reading, write it down in a pocket notebook (or your smartphone). Mr. Willis transfers his new word list to a special vocabulary notebook. 4. Look up the word in a dictionary and write down its meaning in a vocabulary notebook . Whenever you hear or read a new word, you should always stop and try to figure out its meaning from the context in which it is given. But a word can have multiple meanings and shades of meaning, the author or speaker could possibly have used the word incorrectly, and even if you do guess the right meaning, you may quickly forget it. So don't stop there. Once you get a chance, look up the new word you wrote down in your pocket notebook in a dictionary (new dictionary apps make doing this possible on the go), and then write it and its definition in a larger notebook dedicated to learning new vocabulary. Keep the definition short and put it in your own words -- you don't really understand something if you can't explain it yourself. It's also important to jot down the pronunciation of the word -- not with fancy symbols, but phonetically in a way you will understand. For example, for the word ""oblique,"" you could write its pronunciation as ""oh-bleek."" What's great about the advent of online dictionaries is that they often have a button to click to hear the word being spoken aloud. Knowing how to correctly pronounce a word is crucial -- dropping big words into conversation, but saying them incorrectly is worse than not saying the words at all. Once you've written down the proper pronunciation, say the word aloud several times. You might also write down some of the word's synonyms, and even draw a picture that can help you remember its meaning. 5. Use the new word several times in conversation as soon as you can. This will really help sear the word into your mind. Mr. Willis redoes his presentation, this time dropping in words like ""vacillate"" and ""ultimatum"" and the crowd goes wild. Way to go Mr. Willis! Catering Your Vocabulary to Your Crowd Once you start building your vocabulary, you may be tempted to throw out the big words you've learned every chance you get. But just as important as expanding your vocabulary, is learning to use it appropriately. A large vocabulary is not accumulated for showing off; it's a tool that allows you to communicate more effectively. Using the wrong vocabulary at the wrong time negates this function. If you use big, uncommon words with your friends while watching a football game, they might not understand you, and definitely will think you're putting on airs. Ditto for when you're first getting to know someone -- a purposeful display of your large vocabulary will make people think you're smug and pretentious. At the same time, you don't want to fill your speech with slang words when you're being considered by a panel of faculty for a professorship. And while you do want to use technical terms when discussing your invention with fellow scientists, you don't when trying to sell your idea to a layman venture capitalist. You get the idea. Cater your vocabulary to the circumstances and pick words that will allow you both to express yourself and make yourself understood, while being engaging and setting your listener at ease. Never assume a shared vocabulary and know your audience! Finally, always remember Mark Twain's famous admonition to not ""use a five-dollar word when a fifty-cent word will do."" And occasionally, even using a nickel piece is fine; if ""awesome"" or ""epic"" really is the best word to describe how you feel about something, then go for it -- pompous vocab police be damned. I ran a test prep business for quite a few years, and I was always having parents ask me what their young kids should do to prepare for the SAT or ACT. Kids who weren't even in high school yet. A lot of companies are happy to enroll those kids in some course, and keep them paying for classes for the next five years. But what a time and money suck! I mostly told those parents that the very best thing their kids could do is READ. A. LOT. And while reading something is better than nothing, I'd suggest they have their children pick out both classic novels and a variety of periodicals, like Businessweek, The Economist, The New Yorker, Popular Mechanics, Scientific American. Some parents understood that I was offering their child a pattern of self-education that would be worth far more than I could offer them with never-ending flash cards and timed drills. Others didn't seem to understand why I wouldn't immediately offer them some quick-fix course they could pay for. And since my policy was no college test-prep courses for anyone younger than tenth grade, they went searching elsewhere for some place to throw their money. But I still maintain that the number one thing to improve vocabulary, not to mention reading comprehension, critical thinking, and even writing ability, is to simply READ. A. LOT. I fully agree. A robust vocabulary is incredibly useful for all areas of our lives. It helps advance a person more consciously and profoundly. What really defines the mastery of vocabulary however is when to use it in context. Having a huge library of words doesn't mean you have to use them all the time. If something is better said in a simpler fashion then that's the best course to take. It not only shows sophistication but wits for giving the concern that others want to understand you as well. Brevity really is the soul of wit. I Google things all the time. On top of words I come across while reading, a word might just randomly pop into my head and I Google it. Or I might think of something and do some quick research, tonight for instance I was thinking about turbojets and skimmed the wiki page. This weekend is Canadian Thanksgiving, I'm thankful for my Galaxy S3 (and Google, which I guess makes Android OS so just an extension of my phone-love) with LTE internet and 6gb data plan, because my phone spends more time on the internet than anywhere else. More people should do it, you end up learning a little bit about a ton of things. I would also suggest writing as a method to grow your vocabulary. Learning to use new words in writing is a very good way to cement the meanings in your mind. Also, it's embarrassing to know the meaning of a ""five dollar"" word, yet be unable to spell that word. The concept of total literacy seems to be a waning trait in society. Being able to express yourself both in words and writing makes you a much more versatile communicator. I completely agree with the point on reading. I am currently in high school and have been an avid reader for most of my life. It continuously amazes me when I am in English class and come across a word that I have known for years, only to have someone ask the definition of that word. To all people of any age who wish to expand there vocabulary, reading is probably the most effective, as well as the most entertaining way to do so. To those who already have an extensive vocabulary through reading, do you have any suggestions on new reading material for me? I was very happy in high school to see that my love for reading put me in the enviable position of not needing to study vocabulary for the SAT. Alas, the same did not apply when I studied for the GRE -- that was a whole 'nother level! Can anybody suggest a favorite book that is both enjoyable AND has an expansive vocabulary? I've found that the English translations of Les Miserables are amazingly complex (almost florid, sometimes) but are still profound and very fun to read! Excellent post, and timely also. According to research performed by the Princeton Review, the vocabulary of many Americans has diminished greatly over the years. Analyzing presidential debates they found the Lincoln-Douglas debate to be spoken at the educational level of a standard 11th grader. The Bush-Gore debate stood at a 7th grade standard. Tips- *Kindle app is free on Galaxy S3. Amazon offers over 100 classics free also. (The odyssey, crime and punishment, etc...) *Hard copy dictionary on your desk. This is a great post, and very important today. It seems that people's vocabulary is shrinking all the time, even down to bloggers and broadcast journalists. For example, if/when you're reading anything on the net today, look at the amount of times the verd ""to do"" is repeated when it could better be replaced by a synonym such as perform, execute, carry out, operate etc. Great article! I will swear by the reading and listening until I die, as it's the way I've learned to speak English. As I spent a lot of time on the couch watching Dutch subtitled series and reading in English as a child I've never had much use for a 'formal' education in English. I closed the subject in final exams with a 9.5 out of 10, never having really studied a minute. As for pronunciation I highly recommend a poem called 'The Chaos'. It's a high paced lesson in humility if you think you speak English. Be sure to have one of those digital dictionaries handy, as you will need it. A lot. Another way that reading helps improve vocabulary is that when you're reading, you see how the words are actually used. If you just read the dictionary, you may learn several formal definitions, but still not use the word quite right. By reading, you'll get comfortable with how to use specific words and when. This is a great article, and the comments are equally inspiring -- command of one's native language is a skill that differentiates the true lifelong learner from those that finished school, and subsequently finished learning. The only thing I would add would be to make sure your *content* is more than adequate, as well. One's grandiloquent vernacular can be dexterously exercised to camouflage one's paucity of contextual significance. ;-) At dinner every night, we have a word-of-the-day session where everyone is expected to give the definition of a new word. If they didn't come across any by chance, they are allowed to look in books or online for new words, but they must be prepared by supper time. The kids find it to be a fun way to learn. Excellent article. Personally, I like to use Google to define any term I can't remember the full definition for. Google's web history allows me to review those words once in a while. Catering one's words to one's audience is essential. English contains no perfect synonyms, so the purpose of using $5 words is to concisely convey more information. If your audience isn't going to understand the word, then don't waste their time by using it. If you can replace an uncommon word with a common one, then do so. My rule-of-thumb is if someone were to ask what the word means, and I can give a one-word answer, then I just say that instead of the original word. This is great! My dad always emphasizes an increase in vocabulary; his two biggest points are much alike two of your's: Helps you understand other people. Helps you make a good impression on others. He would use those two phrases to encapsulate other points, like increasing confidence, persuasion, comprehension of the world at large . . . His greatest example is that as an engineer his hand-writing is terrible (not universal, but true at least for the engineers in my family and friend group). In his freshman year of university his great-uncle invested in the up-and-coming Macintosh company; my dad's grammar, spelling, and overall grasp on the English language was poor (for no reason besides his lack of attention in school). However, he claims that he passed college because he was able to present a well-styled, typed essay. Presentation is everything to him; a stronger grasp on our vast language allows people like me -- in the social sciences -- to impress upon my audiences a more confident and ""typed"" essay. This subject has long been an obsession of mine. Perhaps it is because the design of a rhetorically sound presentation is one of my strengths. Professionally (I'm a biochemist and cellular biologist), I am surrounded by people a damned sight smarter than me, as is my wife; but I have benefited from a knack for not only putting my finger on the phrase, but for structuring those phrases into stories that engage people. It is my salient strength. What we say is built of the words we use, the order we say them in, and how we look and sound when we say them. It is easy and perhaps erroneous for me to speculate about the reasons why I have this ability; and I run the risk of self-rationalization and self-congratulation in that speculation. I will therefore offer these arrogant thoughts in such limited humility as I can muster in the hope that readers will cast my self importance on the dung heap and perhaps sort some value out of my pretense. I grew up immersed in three story telling traditions: Irish, Northwest Plateau Indian, and the nascent field of television entertainment in which my dad worked. One might say that I was never quite sure if my dad was James Joyces' Finnegan, Chief Joseph, or Ronald MacDonald. I also benefited from being a sick little kid; what you CAN do while you're sick-a-bed is read. Then I discovered bicycles and it was like the realization of flying dreams. Suddenly, I wasn't a sick little kid, I was a vigorous guy who lived on a bicycle. Dropping out of high school with a lottery number of eighteen and thinking that Canada was probably more healthful that Vietnam led me to a career as a bicycle racer, and that in turn led me to a pressing need to learn another language when I was sold to a Belgian team -- we took our orders in French. Much later, after many odd jobs, through a series of short sighted decisions, I was admitted to the University of Washington School of Medicine in the Biochemistry Department on the merit of the skills I had developed as a marijuana farmer and as a salesman. That's another story. Now, I am privileged to work as a scientist because I can do two things: I can write and I can stand in front of an audience of scientists and own their attention. What follows is most emphatically not advice. Rather, it is a description of what I do in addition to those very sound things advised by the authors of AoM. 1) Whenever I am at my desk, I keep a web page open to the OED (Oxford English Dictionary). 2) I am as interested in connotation as denotation. 3) I consider each word I am exposed to in its lexical, stipulative, precising, operative, vernacular, and phonic qualities. 4) I use new words, not necessarily with an audience; but with myself. If we are to use a broad vocabulary with facility rather than sound like someone who is trying to sound smart, the words must spring readily from both our tongues and our finger tips. 5) I sing. Language is not just an intellectual exercise. It is something a dynamic and intelligent animal does. Singing will contribute to your control of voice, tone, and inflection. The only person who sounds bad singing is a person who is afraid to sing. Bark and howl with your dog. Caw with a crow. Honk with a goose. Sing a child's song with a child. They get it. 6) I Listen. There is a music to language, a rhythm, a melody, and it's different for each person, each dialect. I eves drop, on the bus, on the street, in a restaurant, and I try not to judge, but to absorb the song. Each word has a sound. Some are as melodious as the word ""melodious"" and some kick you the way the word ""kick"" does. 7) I listen to my recorded speech. It often appalls me; but I judge it to be worth the courage it takes. 8) I study more than one language. My French stinks, but I liken the effort to the hard work out that makes throwing a perfect punch easy. I do recommend reading ""The Fresh Usual Words"" in the text ""Western Wind"" by David Mason as well as ""The Elements of Style"" by Strunk and White. I also recommend trusting your own voice. You have your own and embracing it will serve you. As Miles Davis told us, ""You have to sound like a lot of other people before you sound like yourself."" Should you find these comments silly, 'taint no never mind, and almost all American English speakers understood that instantly in their gut. I must disparage Andrew on his vain attempt to convey an endorsement without rousing our suspicion. However, such frail efforts to veil the obvious intent of his message are off putting and lead to an aversion of the advertised product. Thanks to art of manliness for featuring our strong man dictionary print. If interested in a copy we'd love to offer the readers a discount. Follow the link to our shop and use coupon code favorite15 and save 15%. I totally agree with your approach above. I have an extensive vocabulary, but am always looking to add new words to my repertoire. I read a lot of news articles as you suggested above (NTY and Reuters) on my morning commute, and follow your approach. Whenever I come upon a word I don't know, I immediately go to my free m-w.com app and look it up and star it so I can refer back to it later. I also try to use the word in conversation properly ASAP, which I believe help me retain its meaning and recall it later. Good advice. Great article on an important -- and often ignored -- facet of manliness. My personal favorite is the advice to read on a wide variety of subjects. I've been an avid reader most of my life and it has not only increased my vocabulary, but it has taught me many things about this great big world we live in. You don't have to read ""War and Peace"", but an article here and there from a hodge-podge of subjects makes it MUCH easier to carry on a conversation. It's very frustrating when you're talking to somebody that has so much to say, and so much that they can contribute to a project, but they don't have the ability to express it. You can tell that they're racking their brain, but just can't find the words. It's not a lack of intelligence, it's a lack of communication skills. Those are the people I try the hardest to encourage to take that next step. Good post! I'm surrounded by a lot of writers who don't know how to 'Cater their Vocabulary to their Crowd'. Or just won'tfor the sake of pretension. I will definitely use these steps to build my vocabulary! Superb post Brett and Kay. It's interesting (and ironic) that you would bring up the ""Autobiography of Malcolm X"" as an example here. That book single-handedly changed my life as I'm now writing this post and glancing over at my second college degree. ""Politics"" aside, I can think of no other man who had such a strong command of the English language and more importantly; the uncanny ability to convey exactly what he wanted to say. Malcolm X was so prolific at the art of oration that he was invited to speak at Oxford University (amongst other places.) This is by all accounts a rather biased opinion but I'm willing to take the heat in this instance. Keep up the good work! Well, I can say that my speech is full of emotions more that meanings, and I have hard time expressing my real thoughts... But I can't say that everything is either awesome, either stupid... I have a lot of opinions about things around me ... I just can't express well... Though thanks for your post ... I think It will help a lot I find that my Kindle is very useful for learning new vocabulary. I have the touch variety, so a simple tap on the screen reveals the definition of almost any unknown word. It's quickly becoming my favorite way to read and I would recommend it to anyone. Read, read, read, read, read. Those of you who ask for reading suggestions may find the AoM Essential Library to be a helpful list. Indeed, the quality of the literature, not the quantity, one consumes ought to hold primacy of place. Never read without a pencil or pen. While reading great (an example of an overused word which I use very specifically here) works, mark interesting words and phrases, and comment to yourself, or to the author, in the margins. I make a list of unknown words on a blank page at the back of a book, include the page number and study these. Of course, use separate paper if you take advantage of the often disregarded cornerstone of western civilization: the library! I really agree with a lot of these points. Ever since I started my own blog, I have spent a lot more time researching, reading, and writing. In performing these practices, my vocabulary has become much more robust. I have even started using an online dictionary when I want to use a word but am unsure of its context. I may need to take a hint from this post and start a vocabulary notebook, that sounds like such a great idea for tangible study. This is a valuable skill to have when conveying a message in written and oral form. Thanks for the post and pointers! I teach a course called ""Introduction to Broadcast Announcing"" to adult learners at the private vocational school where I'm employed. Students at our institution range in age from 18 to 45. In the course, I exhort the students to become ""students of language"" if they intend to earn their living by speaking into a microphone, or by writing words for others to speak on the air. I plan to read several salient passages from this excellent article in class at my earliest opportunity. The other article referenced on eliminating fillers and verbal tics is another that will come in handy I'm sure. Thanks again to Brett and Kate for sharing the fruits of all your reading, researching and writing! Bloviation. I had to look that word up because it caught my eye and I had a little chuckle at what Wikipedia said. Most of the time, Wikipedia articles are a little vague about describing something or maybe it's just the things I look at. Thermodynamics, heavy water, reverse osmosis and all that. Nope, not bloviation. ""...originated in Ohio and used by Warren G. Harding...."" I expected another vague explanation, or origination in Ancient Greek or Egypt and translated but I got blunt truth and I had a good laugh. By the way, no offense intended but Jim Collins' post is a great example. This is a real eye opener. I've been trying this on and off for a little while but I didn't think it could been so powerfully connected to long term vocabulary. I'll be more vigilant about using the new words and keeping up with them. I've even been strictly argus-eyed viewing this article, every new word was copied down into my regular journal but I've got a few other composition books I can use too. Great topic. However, I am not as old as most of the people who have commented here. Therefor instead of praising you, I have a few question. Firstly I am a trilingual male who speaks Russian and Armenian on top of English. When I was a bit younger still in college I used to used word that were common word however when ever I used it around my friend I would have to end up defining the word for them because it was too big for them to comprehend. As time passed I got tired of explaining what everything meant and dumbed down my vocabulary, and now I find myself forgetting the word that I already knew. Since I speak 3 languages, a lot of times I find myself searching for a word because I either have the Russian version in my head or the Armenian. So my questions are, how should I maintain the vocabulary I have without forgetting then because am surrounded by vocabulary challenged people? And secondly since Russian and Armenian are richer languages then English what can I do to remember the English word rather then rack my brain searching to the english equivalent. One of my high school English teachers had an interesting game he showed us students. He would grab a dictionary and open it to any page, then he would read each word and state its definition. If he could not say the meaning of the word he would read the definition a couple of times through, remembering it as best he could then flip to a new page and start anew. Prior to reading your article, I successfully used -- and continue to use -- a similar pattern; it at least corroborates your apposite recommendations. In addition to your outline, I recommend studying logic, rhetoric, and Latin -- three subjects nonpareil in motivating one's study of grammar and vocabulary. Memorizing and applying every rule in Strunk and White's masterwork, The Elements of Style, sways every spoken and written word to the better one. Also, Merriam-Webster freely offers their dictionary app in the Andriod and Apple marketplace; the greatest feature is the 'Synonym Discussion', and it is indispensible for developing a practical and nice vocabulary. Great Post! I would have to say reading and writing down words you're unfamiliar with is the most effective way to expand your vocabulary. One step closer to a living life to full potential and expressing yourself to the best of your abilities. ",2,2
"Of the 2,500 Best of What's New winners we've anointed since 1988, these are the innovations that have made the greatest impact and kept us safer, healthier, and (dare we way) happier than we could have ever been without them. Ever since we inaugurated the Best of What's New (BOWN) awards 25 years ago, the bar we as editors set for our honorees has remained extremely high. Looking back over the 2,500 BOWN-winning products and breakthroughs shows us a history of innovation over the last 25 years. Within that history are digital cameras, smartphones, drones, private space planes, HIV drugs, genome sequencers, personal robots, space stations, electric cars, wireless internet connections, HDTVs, electronic books, MP3 players, and Mars landings. Selecting the 25 most-important innovations from this auspicious group is no small task, so we called in reinforcements. We assembled a panel of nine BOWN editors (past and present) to sift through our roster of winners and select those innovations that have had the greatest, most-lasting impact. With years of collective BOWN experience in the room--an unprecedented reunion--we whittled the list from 2,500 to 25. If the bar to get into BOWN any given year is high, than the bar to be dubbed among the best since 1988 is stupendous. In the end, we all agreed on one thing: We can't imagine a world without these 25 inventions. Nor would we wish to.

Her work has appeared in a variety of other publications including The New York Times , Scientific American , New Scientist , Conservation , Outside , and Backpacker . 3 Comments Frankly, I would disagree with what PopSci editors consider an ""innovation"". I don't really feel that simply building a slightly taller building qualifies as a real science or technology ""innovation"". For sure, true technological leaps in medicine, electronics, materials, etc. would qualify. For example, 25 years ago the technology behind cell phones, the internet, software, TV's, or digital computers, was beyond the imagination of anyone. As for hybrid autos like the Prius, they were conceivable in the 80's. But the amazing efficiency and ultra-low emissions of modern automotive IC engines would not have been thought possible by most people in the 80's. To make a long story short, I would personally disagree with many of your choices for ""top innovations"" over the past 25 years. lol Slightly taller? Its 2,722ft tall. Its over 1000ft taller than the previous record. It wont be matched for about 50 years. It makes other skyscrapers look like sand castles. Its the ""Chuck Norris"" of skyscrapers. ",5,7
"A Country Diary : 14 The Idler's Editor , Tom Hodgkinson , has retired to a Devon farmhouse to write a book . Here 's the fourteenth part of his diary . I 'VE BEEN up in the vegetable patch a lot lately . I consider it to be a freedom-seeking , anarchistic activity and it 's largely enjoyable . It 's the first step on the road to self-sufficiency . However , there are two downsides , one is the sheer amount of hard graft and the other is the expense . Seeds , for starters , cost anything from one to two pounds per packet . I made the mistake of spilling my seed a little too promiscuously with some of the early sowings . I must have planted , for example , around 150 lettuces where there was room for only 15 to grow . That meant throwing away many many seedlings , which seemed like an awful waste . I 've also had to buy planks to build the raised beds , that was a cost of about fifty quid . Then there 's been the wheelbarrow , fork , spade , bamboo canes , bark chipping , black plastic sheeting , Growmore fertiliser , watering cans , sprayer , twine , little plastic pegs for showing you what 's growing where , black plastic sheeting for laying on the paths , bark chippings , gardening books , pencil , weedkiller ( organic ! ) , lime for liming the soil ( whatever that means ) . Luckily I live on a farm so the cowshit is free . Then there 's the enormous amount of time the whole project has taken . If you factor that in , these are going to be the most expensive potatoes ever eaten . I was not prepared either for how complicated the whole thing is . I was given a book called ' The Vegetable and Herb Expert ' to help me learn the ways of the veg , but it has confused me enormously . Every vegetable seems to be different . They require different kinds of soil , light , and watering . Some of them have to be grown indoors and transplanted . Some , thank God , are sown directly into the soil ( which has to be raked to fine "" tilth "" first ) . I got everything the wrong way round and grew the carrots from seed on my windowsill and then transplanted them . You 're supposed to have a greenhouse and also things called cloches . Then I found out that for some vegetables you 're supposed to grow them in a special seed bed , and then transplant them somewhere else when they start shooting through ! I mean , why bother moving them ? Well . I have now planted radishes , runner beans , tomatoes , carrots , parsnips , beetroots , leeks , kale , garlic , onions , salad onions , one single courgette plant ( donated by a neighbour ) , lettuces and a whole bed of potatoes which I painstakingly DOUBLE DUG ( yes , just when you think you 've got the hang of single digging they spring this on you - DOUBLE DIGGING ! ) and filled with cow manure . The radishes are doing well . I was complaining about the amount of expense and hard graft involved in all this to Penny Rimbaud , CRASS founder and experienced vegetable gardener . "" But no ! "" he said . "" It does n ' t have to be . It can be cheap and easy . It 's called permaculture . And there are some gardeners who do n't even believe in digging ! | "" Hmm , I thought . I 'd like to meet them . So I have started looking into permaculture , and it does indeed look fantastic . It 's all about using nature to make your life easier , letting nature do its thing in terms of planting flowers which keep pests down and the like . Rimbaud said also that he is of the "" just bung it in and see "" school which I also like the sound of . Permaculture is also all about sharing seeds and plants , thus cutting down on the expense and allowing you to avoid becoming a victim of the gardening industry . Apparently , the Henry Doubleday Institute runs seed swap programmes and also produces natural old-fashioned varieties that have been all but destroyed by the big commercial seed companies . The only permaculture-type thing I have done so far is to plant marigolds near the tomatoes . Apparently they keep slugs away or something . But expect more permaculture tips soon , as and when I learn them . About six weeks ago , I planted around 40 seed potatoes at neat intervals and they all appeared to be springing up beautifully . I have just showed them proudly to Alan , my mentor in this gardening experiment . He was initially impressed , but then looked a little closer . "" The leaves are looking a bit yellow , "" he said . I looked at them and had to admit he was right . We looked up "" yellowing leaves "" in my book . Definitely not good . Could be a bad case of Blackleg . "" Strikes early in the season , "" my book said . "" Treatment : none . Lift and burn all plants . "" More work . More expense . © 1993-2005 The Idler | Designed by Noble Savage",5,5
"NFL Week 12 -- The Turkey Edition November 25th, 2012 Posted by Laura By the end of Thursday, some head coaches were definitely more thankful than others. After challenging a play that couldn't be challenged (Justin Forsett's 81-yard touchdown in the third quarter), Jim Schwartz changed the landscape of the rest of the game between his Lions and the AFC-leading Texans. And after a sloppy overtime period (a pair of turnovers and two missed field goals), it was Houston who came away with its fifth straight victory. As for the other Thanksgiving games, Robert Griffin III's star was shining even brighter under the lights in Big D (311 passing yards, four touchdowns) while the Patriots embarrassed the Jets after putting up 35 second quarter points in the night cap. With three games already in the books, it's time to look ahead to some of the other key Week 12 match-ups. Remember when the Saints began the season 0-4? Feels like a lifetime ago but the team is right back in the playoff discussion after winning five of its last six games. But beginning with San Francisco, Sunday marks the start of a tough remaining schedule for New Orleans (followed by trips to Atlanta and New York to face the Giants). Will the offence be able to keep up its torrid pace against one of the best defences in the league? Drew Brees has been his typical Drew Brees self this season (28 touchdowns and over 306 passing yards a game) but the Saints have been able to benefit from a reborn running game recently. The club has rushed for at least 140 yards in each of its last three contests, this after surpassing the 100 yard plateau just once in the previous eight games. With an effective rushing attack (Darren Sproles is expected to return after missing the last three games with a broken hand), New Orleans is that much more difficult to defend. But if any team's up for the challenge, it's San Francisco. The Niners are coming off an outstanding defensive performance Monday night against the Bears after recording six sacks, two interceptions and a safety. The unit is allowing less than 14 points (fewest in the league) and just 277 total yards per game. But the Saints offence (averaging over 28 points and 391 yards) present a whole other challenge. In a match-up featuring the last two Super Bowl winners, only one team is playing like a champion these days. Instead of dwelling on what should have been, the Packers have used the blown call in Seattle as motivation reeling off an impressive five game winning streak despite missing some key contributors (Greg Jennings, Sam Shields and Charles Woodson to name a few). The Giants on the other hand, have lost two in a row as Eli Manning and the offence has struggled (hasn't thrown more than 215 yards or a touchdown in any of his last three games). But maybe the bye is just what the doctor ordered. Historically, New York has played well immediately following its off week (winning the last four times in that situation) and has corrected any earlier missteps by going on a late charge in the second half of the season. Why should this year be any different? And while there are many questions surrounding the Giants, this game could come down to the line of scrimmage battle. The Packers lead the NFC with 33 sacks and recorded five last week even without their best defensive player in the lineup (Clay Matthews will miss a second straight game with a hamstring injury). New York has done a good job protecting its quarterback this season with just 12 sacks allowed, but six of those have come in the last two contests (Manning has four turnovers in those games as well). The Giants defence will put the pressure on Aaron Rodgers, but it's the offence that has to step up (just 33 points scored in the last two weeks) if the team hopes to get back on track. They may have the superior record in the NFC South, but the Falcons haven't been playing like the best team in the division lately. After losing its first game of the season back in Week 10, Atlanta followed that up with a disappointing outing against lowly Arizona but got the victory despite a career high five interceptions from Matt Ryan. In fact, it's a mini-miracle the Falcons went so long with a perfect record considering that six of their last seven games have been decided by a touchdown or less. But don't expect Ryan to put up similar numbers this week against a Bucs team that may have the best rush defence in the league, but is ranked dead last against the pass (over 312 yards per game). Even if Julio Jones isn't at full strength (suffering from an ankle injury), Atlanta has the weapons to take advantage of a Tampa D that lives and dies with the blitz. But this won't be a walk in the park for the Falcons. The Bucs are one of the biggest surprises this season and with a victory on Sunday, the team would have its first five game winning streak in a decade. The strength of this Tampa club lies in its offence led by quarterback Josh Freeman who has thrown for multiple touchdowns in each of the last six games (the team is averaging more than 34 points over that span). And while the Falcons will be looking to exploit the mismatch in the passing game, standout rookie Doug Martin should see lots of work against an Atlanta team allowing five yards per carry, one of the worst marks in the league. Offence will be the name of the game between these division rivals. ",5,4
"Anyone can make a nomination for the awards, but all nominations must be made through the OAYP website. Youth Awards trustee Emmy O'Shaughnessy added: ""A group of young people have been involved in the past, but their role has mainly involved helping with the latter stages of the Youth Awards process. ""The major difference to really stress is that this year the youth committee are being involved in every aspect of realising the youth awards. ""They are responsible for designing posters, tickets, banners, slogans and are involved in fundraising, raising awareness of the event through social media, finding performers for the night, and of course the event production. ""The school was chosen due to its proximity to OAYP headquarters, and to build up a positive local relationship between youth organisation and school. ""Wheatley Park School also has a wide range of students who live in both city and rural environments."" This year the event has received additional backing from Carl Anglim, the founder of Oxford Fashion Week, who learnt about the awards scheme through his work at the centre for business and innovation at Science Oxford . There he was impressed by youngsters' enthusiasm and met Dave Hutchinson, the chairman of OAYP, who asked if he would be interested in being a trustee. Mr Anglim, 26, added: ""There's a bit of an obsession with problems associated with young people. ""Our focus is to say that young people do incredible things. ""The awards are different this year, there's more of them and I'm really interested to see the sort of nominations we get.""

"Free Self-Help Guides and Mental Health Information There is something special about writing words onto a page, something helpful about releasing our inner thoughts and committing them to paper, especially when we are in pain. It is as though by this very act alone our mind is freed. Our thoughts no longer swim and chase each other around. There is definition and order to the chaos within our mind and the words on the page become revelatory as we seek to understand our own pain and heal from it. The value of individuals recording their thoughts has been present throughout our history -- there are many examples of this. One which springs to mind is Anne Frank's diary which gave us an unforgettable and intimate window into the horrors of The Holocaust. But diaries and journals don't need to become famous to have value. Therapists and counsellors have long espoused the benefits of diary/journal writing. They encourage their clients to embark on this action as a way of healing from, and making sense of, emotional distress. If you are wondering about its value, here are a few thoughts on writing a journal: How to write a journal -- the idea is to write a little every day, at a time that suits you. Write in a book which is specifically dedicated to this activity and, if possible, has pages which are not loose-leaf. The aim is to feel that this is a place of unbridled confession. The value of writing by hand, if you are able to, means that your thoughts issue forth and are not censored -- as they are when writing at a keyboard. There are no 'mistakes' here, all words and thoughts are of value and have meaning. What to write in a journal -- anything and everything! As this is a fully private space anything can be put onto the page. So much of our day is spent keeping our feelings closed in and under control. This is where you can let out all that you feel: good, bad and ugly. Talk about your day, things that have happened, emotions you have felt, things said to you. When you are struggling with difficult feelings you can also consider writing to people. Write things down that you cannot say in person. Perhaps a person is no longer with you, or it is no longer possible to speak to someone to voice your pain. Or maybe you find uttering words face-to-face impossible. Pour the words and thoughts onto the page without planning or thought, just let them flow and let the pain and anger surface and have a voice. Also, your journal doesn't just have to contain writing, diagrams can be useful. If, for example, you are struggling with a decision about something or want to figure out some options, creating a picture -- mind mapping -- can be really helpful. Reflect on your journal writing -- this is an important step in the process and shows why it is so useful to keep all of your thoughts recorded in one place. You can reflect daily, weekly or look back over time at the feelings you have had. Now that your pain finally has a legitimate voice: not hidden, not guarded, not sanitised, you can see how your feelings have changed over time. You can also analyse some of your thinking. It may be that some of your thoughts are wrong and some of the beliefs you have, about yourself and others, are incorrect. Seeing your views in print, acknowledging them, you now have a chance to challenge them. Having a private, yet permanent, record also serves as a reminder of things you have previously worked out but since forgotten -- it's surprising how often this happens. Keep writing -- it's easy to get distracted and lose touch with ourselves but journal writing allows our thoughts and emotions free reign in a safe setting. If you have found the process of writing valuable then keep setting aside that small daily amount of time to keep on top of your feelings and allow an outlet for your emotions. If you haven't yet ventured into writing a journal it is something worth trying. If you are in therapy, your counsellor has undoubtedly suggested it as a useful tool for self-knowledge. Any old exercise book will do. Or perhaps you can find a beautifully bound book of empty pages which feels like a treasure to hold and look at. Begin to write a little of yourself onto the pages and see the value of this simple, yet sometimes life-changing, enterprise. Write out your pain, rather than hold it all inside of you, and see if your mind feels freer for the process. ",2,1
"It is sad that this has happened. The Nairn Riverside has also suffered from vandalism. The HC locked the gates, yet when I visited, teenagers were throwing a ball against what remains of the kirk; all they had to do was climb (as I did :-) Being from the US, our history is relatively ""new"" in the scheme of things. Most of our historic sites are protected and they certainly do not date to Scotland's. As an example, we have Wormsloe in Georgia, the last remaining ruins of a tabby fortified house (erected in the 1770's? - forget when). Scotland's history goes back so much further. I remember how thrilled I was to visit Wormsloe even though you cannot make much out of what is left of the homestead. When I visited Scotland, WOW, that is all I can say. A HUGE WOW! Not being familiar with how it works in Scotland, I cannot speak with regard to whom is responsible for the restoration; but in all honesty, what does it matter? The burial grounds in Scotland should be considered a national treasure and protected as such just as Wormsloe in the US. Perhaps a place for donations should be set up to recover what was lost.

"The South Wales Caving Club Expedition to The Franche Comte ( The Jura and the Doubs ) 23rd July to 6th August 2005 Franche-Comté is the name given to the vast area of woodland which lies to the north of the French Alps in Eastern France , and stretches southward along the Swiss border for 250km , from Vosges to the Jura . The region is divided into four different départements , the Haute-Saône , Doubs , Jura and Territoire de Belfort , the first three of which all contain important cave systems . The Franche-Comte is brimming with sites of outstanding natural beauty , including Alpine meadows , lakes , cirques , waterfalls , thick forest and some of the most beautiful rivers in France . Glaciation , high rainfall and copious Spring snowmelt has encouraged plentiful erosion on the predominant Jurassic limestone landscape , resulting in a full range of karst features , including of course , several thousand cave systems . Where is it ? ... As you can probably appreciate from the map extract , the area is quite a large one . It nestles up against the Franco Swiss border immediately east of Dijon . We will be based roughly in the middle in a picturesque little town called Ornans which is located on the D67 about 20km south of Besancon . The area is probably best reached using the Dover - Calais or Folkstone - Calais crossings . A route is available which cuts south east around Reims and Dijon which negates the need to get tangled up with Paris . An alternative more elongated route swings up into Belgium and down across Luxembourg to drop back into France at Nancy . The auto routes are all free of toll on this route but it does take a little longer . A little about the local geology ..... The region can be divided into three major zones , the Mountains , the Plateau Ridges and the Lowlands . The mountains are located in the east and follow a NE-SW axis along the Swiss border . They are quite small mountains for the area , the highest peak being Cret de la Neige , at 1718m high . A few Alpine style shaft systems can be explored in this zone . Parallel with the mountains lies an extensive series of Plateau Ridges , which range in height from 900m to 400m , stepping down gradually from East to West . These gently undulating agricultural regions , are home to the majority of the caves ( including most of the major systems ) , particularly around the spectacular river gorges separating the ridges . The final region , the lowlands , occupies the north of the region , but includes only a few notable caves , formed in isolated ridges . The waters drain North-West from the eastern mountains to the Saone valley . To get there they have to cross the plateau ridges , for which there are only two possible options , via Cluses ( narrow gorges cutting through the ridges ) or via caves , which is why the majority of cave systems are found within the Plateau Ridges region . The whole region has been subject to quite severe folding and faulting , and this has had a powerful effect on cave development . Underground drainage is predominantly directed along the axis of the folds . Since the dip is generally shallow , underground streams can travel very large distances and the separation from sinks to resurgence can be considerable ( the longest positive trace is from Seignes de Passonfontaine to Source du Maine , a distance of 28km over a vertical range of nearly 500m ) . However , the narrow widths of the synclinal folds acts as a limit on overall catchment areas and consequently many major systems consist of single streamways , albeit of great length . The resurgences are often large and impressive , but almost invariably flooded for a considerable distance . The feeders to these Collecteurs are predominantly vertical , simple shaft systems , of not very great depth ( commonly between 100m and 300m ) . Most peter out in mud chokes and impenetrable cracks , but a few utilise tectonic fractures to connect directly into the Collecteurs . There are probably many more of these , hidden beneath a blanket of alluvium . A third type of cave passage is found in ancient , fossil remnants , located in the higher beds . Due to the relative youth of the Jurassic formation , these are quite scarce , but typically feature large , dry tunnels , often adorned with huge , muddy formations . So what are the caves like ? ....... The caves of the Franche-Comte are generally simple in plan , with a series of vertical Dales like pots feeding long , linear streamways . This is partly due to the geology and partly due to the relative youth of the Jurassic formations . The caves are commonly wet , muddy and well-decorated , often with large formations . Jurassic limestone can be thinly-bedded and brittle , so care should be taken when climbing or traversing . The weather is generally sunny , but punctuated by sudden and severe thunderstorms . This can create real problems , for the water tends to flash through the caves very quickly . Pitch heads should be rigged as far out of potential flood water as possible and long trips into streamways are best timed to avoid the late afternoons . The vast majority of caves in the Franche-Comte are prone to flooding of one degree or another , so it is best to take some food and survival kit on most trips . On the plus side , the water is likely to drop as fast as it rises , so a few hours wait will normally allow for a safe exit . Choice of personal kit can also be difficult . Many of the dry caves can be very warm , requiring only the lightest of clothing . On the other hand , the wet caves often require full wetsuits . Over 5000 caves have been mapped , the majority of which are horizontal systems . Approximately 100 caves exceed 1km , 50 exceed 2km , and no less than 15 exceed 5km in length . No very deep caves exist , but of the vertical systems , three exceed 300m in vertical range , and more than 50 exceed 100m . The region is equally famous for cave diving and includes some of the most extensive submerged networks in Europe . Here is a short list of the sort of thing available ..... Reseau de la Verneau Traverse ( Bief-Boussets to Baudin ) - 9km long , 345m deep . One of the classic French through trips . Big stream , very flood-prone . 12 hour + trip . 4th longest cave in France ( 30km ) . In same class as PSM , Dent de Crolles , Diau , Felix Trombe i . e about as good as it gets . Includes pitches up and down and a 5m free-diveable sump ( do n't worry , can be bypassed ) . Grotte de Chauveroche - 6 km to sump with lots of swimming ( 204 pools !!! ) . Then 6 km back out . Julian Walford , who found Claonaite and Pollballiny reckons it 's the best stream cave he 's ever done . A wet-suit trip . Another French classic . Hard . Gouffre de Pourpeville - 9 km long . Entrance pitches drop into big well-decorated galleries . La Borne Aux Cassots - 15 km horizontal cave with good formations . Combination lock . Part streamway , part big pretty stuff . Gouffre de Granges-Mathieu - 25m pitch to bizarre gate ( climb over ) then lots of pretty passage to fantastically decorated final chamber . Gouffre de la Baume St Anne - Basically a big 85m deep daylight shaft much like Alum Pot . Not much else ( much like Alum Pot ) . The Dutch think it 's fab . Gouffre de Montaigu - Deepest cave in area . Impressive pitches . Gouffre de Vauvougier - Sporting . Over 200 meters deep , its pits and meanders provide numerous surprises . No pretties or big passages though . 10 hr + hard trips . Baume de la Faviere - Basically Vertical to - 229 metres Caborne de Menouille - Through trip from Gouffre du Cernon possible - but very polluted . Vertical round trip possible from resurgence , including 60m shaft . Gouffre du Mont Ratey - Superb cave . Beautiful and deep but very flood prone . Grotte du Cul de Vau - 4 km long . Underground river . Lots of swimming .. which should be enough to keep everyone going for a while . Plus - Via Ferrata adjacent to Verneau resurgence . Camping ... The campsite is booked ! We have reserved 8 pitches in the area of the site that projects out to the west ( look for 14B on the map ) . Mr Clipstone kindly carried out a reconnaissance of the site and informs us that these are the best ones with a good deal of shade and nice flat pitches . The site itself had been recommended by several well respected cavers and to boot it turns out that the Wessex mega trip this year ( 50 plus attendees ) used the same site . The url for the site is http://www.lechanet.com / . It seems to be a very tidy site with loads of amenities including ' Le Snack Bar ' and of course La Piscine . Camping on the site gives you complimentary access to the Piscine Municipal which is a few hundred metres up the road . Money , Money Money ... Until we get a better idea of numbers we have only reserved 8 pitches . We are working on the basis that people may want to share pitches and hence reduce the cost . If you would like to reserve a complete pitch then would you be so good as to forward a cheque for £ 40.00 . If you would like to share a pitch would you please forward a cheque for £ 20.00 . Cheques should be made payable to ' Cantabria Expeditions' Pitches will obviously go on a first come first served basis . If numbers require further pitch reservations I will make these reservations as and when it becomes obvious that we need them . I 'm not guaranteeing that we will get more pitches but it sounds like the area where the Wessex camped ( northernmost triangle ) is pretty open plan and although quite steep and devoid of shade will probably accommodate last minute bookings . One or two of the families have booked the mobil home accommodation available on the site ( no prizes for guessing who ! ) . If you would like to reserve one of these do let me know or speak to the campsite direct .

Firstly, in the Euro we would have a fixed exchange rate, no independent monetary policy, and fiscal policy would be severely curtailed. Housing Bubble The years 2000 to 2007 were relatively stable for the Eurozone and Euro. However, due to stronger growth in the UK, ECB interest rates were lower than the Bank of England interest rates. Between 2003 and early 2005, ECB interest rates were 2%, UK rates were higher at around 4%. If the UK had been in the Euro, we could have seen a bigger asset bubble during the years 2003-06. Lower interest rates would have encouraged more people to enter the housing market, causing an even bigger increase in house prices. These lower interest rates would have caused higher economic growth in the period 2000-07, but at the cost of a bigger credit and housing boom. If house prices had risen faster (04-07), they would have been a bigger fall post 2008. The fall in house prices post 2008 was a drag on consumer spending and contributed to bank losses. If house prices fell at a great rate, then the financial crash would have been more painful and banks lost even more money. Response to Recession of 2008. The economic and financial crisis of 2008 hit the UK more than most other European economies. This was partly because the UK's economy has a bigger reliance on banking and finance -- sectors adversely affected by the credit crunch. Other European economies, such as Germany also saw a big fall in GDP during 2009, but were able to bounce back from recession quicker than the UK and southern Europe. In response to this fall in output, the UK pursued a different monetary and fiscal policy to the rest of Europe. If the UK had been in the Euro, we would not have been able to pursue this independent monetary and fiscal policy. How UK Policy Differed from European Policy Interest rates were cut to 0.5% in March 2009 -- quicker than the ECB cut interest rates. The government announced some fiscal expansion (tax cuts) and spending increases to provide a fiscal stimulus up until 2010. The pursuit of quantitative easing and the deep recession, caused the pound to fall 20%. This helped domestic demand by making UK exports more competitive and imports more expensive. If the UK was in the Euro, we would have not benefited from the depreciation in the currency, and export demand would have been even lower. Admittedly, the benefits of a 25% depreciation were less than might have been expected. This was due to the low export demand in Europe. But, a strong Pound in 2009, would have made the economic situation even more difficult for UK manufacturing. If the UK was in the Euro, interest rates, set by the ECB, would have fallen slower at the start of the recession. Also, the ECB increased interest rates in 2011 -- concerned about inflationary pressures. This would have worsened the UK double dip recession. The ECB have often shown much more concern over inflation than the Bank of England. The Bank of England tolerated cost-push inflation of 5% -- but the ECB have greater emphasis on always keeping inflation on target. (see: ECB v Bank of England ) You could argue in a liquidity trap lower interest rates haven't made much difference anyway, but if the UK had higher interest rates in the recession, we might have seen more homeowners and business default on mortgages and loans. Despite these unorthodox measures, the UK economy was slow to recover. This might suggest they were ineffective. But, without the monetary and fiscal stimulus, the recession would have been even deeper and longer than we experienced. Bond Yields and Fiscal Crisis After 2009, many countries in the Eurozone saw rapid increases in bond yields. Starting with Greece and then spreading to Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. Bond yields rose for various reasons, but an important reason was because markets feared the liquidity of countries in the Eurozone. In the Eurozone, there is no Central bank to step in and buy bonds if necessary. This makes countries more susceptible to liquidity crisis, and therefore bond yields rose. (see more explanation here: Independent currency and economic performance ) There is a dramatic divergence between the UK / Germany and Eurozone economies. Would the UK have experienced rising bond yields like Ireland, Italy and Portugal or would the UK have been seen as a safe haven like Germany? Given the scale of the UK's recession and budget deficit -- it is very hard to imagine the UK being seen as a safe haven like Germany. The UK had one of the highest budget deficits in the Eurozone -- at over 11% of GDP in 2009/10, it was second to only Greece. If we compare the relative budget deficits of UK with Portugal, Spain and Italy -- you might expect bond yields to be the other way around. It shows that being in the Euro, makes you much more susceptible to rising bond yields. If the UK had been in the Euro, I believe we would have experienced a similar fate to Italy and Spain. Markets would have taken fright and stopped buying UK bonds. This would have pushed up bond yields and encouraged the government to pursue greater and deeper austerity. This would have caused a deeper double dip recession. There is evidence that such austerity measures are self-defeating , but in the Euro the UK would almost certainly have pursued  much bigger spending cuts and higher taxes. It would have left us in the unwelcome situation of falling GDP and struggling to reduce a debt to GDP ratio. Conclusion If the UK had been in the Euro we would have had a much deeper and longer lasting recession. We would almost certainly  have faced a bond crisis resulting from the market fears over Euro bonds. This would have created a pressure to pursue really deep austerity. This austerity would have caused a much deeper double dip recession and left the UK with few options to promote growth and reduce unemployment. Furthermore, we would also be facing an overvalued exchange rate with a decline in competitiveness which would put even bigger downward pressures on real wages and output. If the UK had been in the Euro, it would have increased the likelihood of the Euro breaking up. A fiscal crisis in the UK would require even bigger bailout funds that would have made it more difficult to deal with. Staying out of the Euro was good for the UK, but also very good for the rest of the Eurozone. ",5,4
"Abstract Objective: Reporting bias due to social desirability is an important consideration in carrying out surveys on sensitive issues. The study compared the frequency of self reported sensitive behaviours and response rates between the conventional ""telephone interviewer method"" (TIM) and a combined interviewer and computerised data capturing method (telephone interviewer and computerised questionnaire method, or TICQM). Methods: A total of 580 males and 582 females were recruited and randomly assigned to either of the two methods in a cross sectional study. The overall response rate was about 51.6%. Results: While the two methods both had high completion and low item non-response rates, the TICQM respondents reported higher frequencies of sensitive risk behaviours. Sexually active female respondents interviewed by the TICQM were more likely to report that their sex partners were their steady boyfriend, instead of their husband; and were also more likely to admit that they had had ""one night stand"" experiences or had undergone an HIV antibody test, when compared with their counterparts in the TIM group. Similar contrasts were observed for sexually active male respondents, that the TICQM group were more likely to report that they had had sexual intercourse with female sex workers or non-regular sex partners. Sex differences in the strength of association were observed between some studied behaviours (for example, HIV testing and substance abuse) and modes of data collection. Conclusion: The choice of data collection method has a significant impact on the results of sensitive studies; special attention should be given to designing the study and interpreting the results. Methodological issues such as participation bias, reporting bias, and effects of modes of administration on respondents' responses are of critical consideration in the study of sexual behaviours and other sensitive topics. Respondents tend to respond in socially desirable ways, especially in face to face interviews. 1 Hence, data collection methods that ensure anonymity and confidentiality are of great importance. There are some studies addressing the influence of different administration modes on sexual behaviour reporting. 2 -- 8 Some found that the use of audio-questionnaires resulted in fewer missing responses and higher frequency of reported risk behaviours than self administered written questionnaires. 2 Others found that audio computer interviewing methods resulted in higher frequencies of risk behaviours than face to face interview. 3 The use of a computerised questionnaire data collection method in combination with the use of mobile phone was also found to be reporting higher frequencies of risk behaviours. 5 As telephone interviews have frequently been used to study sexual behaviours, 9 -- 12 an innovative data collection method which can reduce reporting bias of telephone surveys would have important implications. This study aimed to compare the frequencies of HIV related attitudes and risk behaviours as reported by two modes of telephone survey methods. The proportion completing the questionnaire and the number of item non-responses were also compared. The study tested the hypothesis that the results of HIV related studies, which examine sensitive risk behaviours, are in fact affected by the mode of data collection. METHODS Respondents The target population consisted of Chinese speaking male and female adults (aged 18 -- 60) living in Hong Kong. In total, 1162 respondents were recruited, among which 580 were male and 582 were female. The two methods under comparison The first method of the study was the conventional ""telephone interviewer method"" (TIM), which had the entire questionnaire (consisting of two parts, see below) administered by interviewers; the second method (the ""telephone interviewer and computerised questionnaire method"" or TICQM) used exactly the same questionnaire, but while part I of the questionnaire was being administered by the interviewers, part II used an interactive computerised method instead. The computerised questionnaire was presented in a female voice. Procedure Four experienced interviewers (three females and one male) were recruited for the study. All of them had at least one year of experience in implementing telephone surveys of HIV related studies. Half of the respondents were randomly allocated to one of the two methods (TIM or TICQM). Each interviewer completed the same number of questionnaires using the two different methods. The potential confounding effect caused by differences of individual interviewers and sex was hence removed by the study design. Telephone numbers were randomly selected from up to date residential telephone directories, stratified by the three major geographic regions of Hong Kong. Most of the Hong Kong residents have telephones at home (Hong Kong Office of the Telecommunications Authority, personal communication, 28 January 2000). The study was carried out from June to July 2001. All interviews were conducted between 6 pm and 10.30 pm in order to avoid oversampling of unemployed people and housewives. Unanswered telephone numbers were attempted at least three times before being classified as invalid. Of each sampled household a member, aged 18 -- 60 and whose past birthday was closest to the day of the interview, was invited to participate in the study. All respondents were invited by the interviewers to join the study with the same greetings and briefing. Prospective respondents were briefed that the study was going to collect opinions about HIV/AIDS prevention and it was sponsored by the Hong Kong Council for the AIDS Trust Fund, and that their contribution would help government's policy formulation. For those who agreed to join the study, irrespective of which method group they were being randomly assigned, they were asked the same non-sensitive questions (part I of the questionnaire). After completing part I, they were invited to join part II of the study which asked about sensitive personal questions. The phrasing of the invitation to join part II was the same for respondents of the two method groups. However, for the TIM group, respondents went on to be questioned by the interviewers; while for the TICQM group, respondents were told that the questions were prerecorded in a computerised phone system (the ""dot line"" service), and that they only needed to key in their responses. They were then connected to the telecommunication service in Hong Kong via a conference line service (allowing one of the two parties to call a third party without hanging up and allowing all three parties to have simultaneous phone conversation) after the briefing. The interviewer left the line after the connection was made. Respondents then completed the computerised questionnaire by keying in their responses after listening to the prerecorded questions. The ""dot line"" telephone number was not released to the respondents. The service has often been used by TV stations for public opinion polling and is widely known to the public. All respondents were guaranteed that their telephone number would not be recorded. Anonymity and confidentiality were therefore enhanced. The TICQM has been employed in a number of local studies. 9, 13 -- 15 A literature search showed that this method had been original. Out of all telephone calls made, 23.8% were non-contacts (after three attempts) and about 20% were non-households. Among those contacted households (these households with someone answering the call), 40% were invalid households (without or could not contact an eligible respondent), 29% refused to join the study, and 31% completed the study. An overall response rate, defined as the number of respondents completing the study divided by the number of completed interviews plus refusals, was 51.6%. This is comparable with other telephone surveys conducted in Hong Kong. 9, 14, 16 -- 18 On average, it took the TICQM respondents about 7 -- 8 minutes and the TIM respondents about 5 -- 6 minutes to complete part II of the questionnaire. Measurements Two structured questionnaires, one for males and one for females and each consisting of two parts, were used. Part I but not part II of the questionnaire was common to both the male and female respondents. Part I asked about non-sensitive questions; part II asked sensitive questions on sexual risk behaviours and HIV/AIDS related topics. Part I Respondents were asked to mention three routes of HIV transmission and their perception on condom efficacy (""What is your perceived efficacy of condom use for HIV prevention?""). Data on age and education level were also collected. Part II In the female questionnaire, respondents were asked if they had had any sex partner in the past 6 months. Only those who answered that they had had at least one sex partner in the past 6 months went on to answer the subsequent questions, including whether they did have a husband in the past 6 months; and if so, whether they had had sexual intercourse with their husband in the past 6 months, whether they perceived that they were able to insist on using condoms if they suspected that their husband had patronised female sex workers (FSW) in the past 6 months, and their perceived chance of contracting HIV from their husband. A similar set of four questions with respect to steady boyfriend (including cohabiting boyfriend) was also asked. In addition, respondents were asked whether they had an experience of a ""one night stand"" in the past 6 months, whether they had contracted an STD, had undergone an HIV antibody test, and had indulged in substance abuse in the past 6 months. A total of 13 questions were asked. In the male questionnaire, respondents were asked about whether they had patronised FSW in the past 6 months; if yes, whether they had always used (that is, used every time) condoms when having sexual intercourse with an FSW. Respondents were also asked if they had regular and non-regular female sex partners in the past 6 months. If so, whether they had always used condoms when having sexual intercourse with these partners, respectively. In addition, they were asked whether they had ever had sexual intercourse with another man, whether they had contracted an STD, had undergone an HIV antibody test, and had indulged in substance abuse in the past 6 months. They were also asked about their perceived susceptibility to HIV infection. A total of 11 questions were asked. Statistical analysis Separate statistical analyses were performed for the two sexes as two different part II questionnaires were used. The distributions of the studied variables were tabulated by the two methods. The ? 2 test and logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and education level (adjusted odds ratios (adjusted OR) and their respective 95% confidence interval (CI)) were performed to examine the statistical significance of the differences between the two methods. SPSS for Windows (version 11.0) was used for statistical analyses and p &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS Percentages completing different parts of the questionnaires All respondents (of both methods) who started part I completed that part of the study. There were a few (male, TIM: 2.1% and TICQM: 1.8%; female, TIM: 2.7% and TICQM: 1.7%) respondents who completed part I of the study but refused to join part II of the study. Among the TICQM respondents, about 1 -- 2% (male, 1.0%; female, 2.1%) of them did not start part II because of technical problems. Less than 1% (TIM: 0.4%; TICQM: 0.7%) of the male respondents started but did not finish part II; similar figures were 0.4% (TIM) and 4.6% (TICQM) for female respondents. In sum, the majority of the male respondents who started part I finished the entire questionnaire (97.6% and 96.6% respectively for the TIM and TICQM); for female respondents, similar percentages were 96.9% (TIM) and 91.8% (TICQM), respectively. In other words, once the respondents started the interview, most of them were likely to complete the entire questionnaire. Among females, however, the incompletion rate of the TICQM was about 4% higher than that of the TIM. Item non-responses For both methods, there were only very few missing responses for individual part II questions. When TIM respondents did not answer a certain question, it was recorded by the interviewer; whereas for TICQM respondents, no data were entered into the system. Altogether, the TIM group only had eight cases of non-response and the TICQM group only had four of such cases. Background characteristics of respondents Responses to part I questions on age, education level, HIV related knowledge (HIV transmission routes), and perceived efficacy of condom use for HIV prevention are summarised in table 1. No statistically significant differences were observed on these variables when the two methods were compared. Therefore, respondents to the two methods were comparable in general and these two methods were giving similar results for non-sensitive questions. About the same percentages of female respondents to the two methods reported that they had had at least one sex partner in the past 6 months (TIM: 64.8% and TICQM: 65.5%, ? 2 test, p = 0.849; table 2). However, over 90% (91.8%) of these sexually active women in the TIM group said that they had had sexual intercourse with their husband (while only 72.0% of the TICQM group said so) and only 5.5% of the TIM group said that they did not have a husband (compared to 23.4% of the TICQM group); 91.2% of these sexually active women of the TIM group said that they did not have a steady boyfriend and only 8.2% admitted that they had had sexual intercourse with their boyfriend. On the other hand, only 47.4% of the TICQM group said that they did not have a steady boyfriend and 40.6% of this group reported that they had had sexual intercourse with their boyfriend (table 2). Frequencies of self reported behaviours and perceptions among female respondents In other words, although female TIM respondents were equally likely to state that they were sexually active, it was much more likely for such sexually active TIM respondents than sexually active female TICQM respondents to indicate that their sex partner was their husband rather than their boyfriend. Sexually active women in the TIM group were less likely than those in the TICQM group to report being unmarried but having had sexual intercourse with a steady boyfriend (4.9% in TIM versus 18.3% in TICQM, ? 2 test, p &lt;0.001; adjusted OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.53, p = 0.001; data not tabulated). Further, of the sexually active women, 4% in the TICQM group admitted that they had had a ""one night stand"" experience in the past 6 months but none of the TIM group reported such behaviour (? 2 test, p = 0.006; table 2). A similar observation was obtained for the response to the question asking whether they had indulged in substance abuse in the past 6 months (2.9% in TICQM versus 0.0% in TIM, ? 2 test, p = 0.022; table 2). As well, more female TICQM respondents reported having undergone an HIV antibody test in the past 6 months compared to female TIM respondents (10.9% in TICQM versus 1.7% in TIM; adjusted OR = 7.51, p = 0.002; table 2). Female TICQM respondents were more likely to perceive some/high chance of contracting HIV from their husband than female TIM respondents (30.2% in TICQM versus 19.4% in TIM, adjusted OR = 1.81, p = 0.033; table 2). For those female TICQM respondents who suspected their husband had patronised an FSW, they were less likely to perceive themselves as being able to insist on using condoms with their husband under such circumstances (TICQM: 60.3% and TIM: 73.5%, adjusted OR = 0.53, p = 0.015; table 2). Three other items did not reach statistical significance when the TICQM and the TIM groups were compared. They included the prevalence of contracting an STD in the past 6 months, perceived chance of contracting HIV from their steady boyfriend, and perceived capacity to insist on using condoms if suspecting their steady boyfriend had patronised an FSW (see table 2). As seen from table 3, the male TICQM group also reported higher frequencies of some sexually related behaviours than the male TIM group. These included higher frequencies for having had sexual intercourse with an FSW in the past 6 months (adjusted OR = 3.36, p = 0.001) and having had a non-regular sex partner in the past 6 months (adjusted OR = 3.18, p = 0.004). Similar to the findings obtained from the female respondents, sexually active male TIM respondents were more likely to state that they had had a regular sex partner in the past 6 months, compared to their TICQM counterparts (93.8% in TIM versus 85.4% in TICQM, adjusted OR = 0.4, p = 0.017). Two other comparisons were of marginal statistical significance (0.05 &lt; p &lt;0.1). The prevalence for ever having had sexual intercourse with another man was higher in the male TICQM group (2.2%), compared to the male TIM group (0.4%) (? 2 test, p = 0.055). A higher percentage of male TICQM respondents also self reported having contracted an STD in the past 6 months compared to male TIM respondents (? 2 test, p = 0.098; table 3). Frequencies of self reported behaviours and perceptions among male respondents The other comparisons in table 3 were not of statistical significance. These included whether always using condoms when having had sexual intercourse with an FSW in the past 6 months, whether always using condoms with non-regular sex partners among those who reported having had a non-regular sex partner in the past 6 months, whether having indulged in substance abuse in the past 6 months, self perceived susceptibility of HIV infection and HIV antibody testing behaviours, etc (table 3). DISCUSSION The respondents were interviewed by the two methods during the same time period, using the same standardised questionnaire and a randomised design to remove interviewer effects. The two samples were comparable in terms of demographic background and HIV related knowledge and attitude (part I). However, substantial and significant differences were detected for both the male and the female respondents using the two modes of data collection (the only difference accounting for the observed differences between the two methods). Much higher frequencies of various sensitive attitudes and behaviours were reported by female respondents of the TICQM group when compared to responses given by females of the TIM group. These behaviours/attitudes were likely to be socially undesirable. For instance, having premarital sex is not desirable in the Chinese culture. As a result, women who admitted that they were sexually active might be pressured to say that their sex partner was their husband rather than their boyfriend. Other differences between the female TIM and TICQM groups in their responses to sensitive questions such as having had an experience of ""one night stand,"" substance abuse, HIV antibody testing, etc, also supported the claim. A similar pattern was also found among the male respondents -- sexually active male TIM respondents were more likely to indicate that they had had sexual intercourse with a regular sex partner and were less likely to report having had sex with a non-regular sex partner, compared to their counterparts in the TICQM group. Male TICQM respondents were also more likely to admit having engaged in commercial sex behaviours than male TIM respondents. It is also noted that among sexually active female respondents in the TIM group, 91.8% reported having had sex with their husband and 8.2% with their steady boyfriend. In other words, very few of the women in the TIM group admitted having had extramarital sex. However, such percentages were 72.0% (with husband) and 40.6% (with steady boyfriend) respectively in the TICQM group. Therefore, about 12% in the TICQM group admitted having had sex with both their husband and boyfriend. There are no reported data on extramarital sex among women in Hong Kong. The above mentioned findings therefore suggest a direction for further research. Similar trends were also found among males. Among sexually active male respondents in the TIM group, 93.8% reported having had sexual intercourse with a regular sex partner, 5.1% with a non-regular sex partner, and 3.9% with an FSW; whereas for the TICQM group, the three respective values were 85.4%, 14.6%, and 11.1%. Further, a few comparisons of the male TIM and TICQM groups (such as the prevalence of STD and sex with another man) reached marginal statistical significance (0.05 &lt;p &lt;0.1), suggesting that were the sample size increased, statistical significance could have been reached for these variables. In summary, though not all comparisons are significant, the results consistently show that TICQM respondents, especially the female ones, were more likely to report higher frequencies of risk behaviours. The social pressure faced by the TIM respondents may be larger than those of the TICQM respondents. The former was responding to a person (the interviewer) and the latter was responding to a machine (computer), in the absence of a person. The findings reinforce the conclusion of a similar study carried out in Hong Kong, comparing three modes of data collection methods in behavioural surveillance studies. 5 The results of that study concluded that the method giving a higher level of perceived confidentiality and anonymity would yield higher frequencies of self reported risk behaviours. In the present study, switching to a prerecorded and computerised questionnaire created a better perception of confidentiality, as the interviewers left the telephone line when the respondents were answering the questions. The simple ""key in"" responding mode also reduced the chance of being overheard by other family members when the respondents were answering the very sensitive questions. These may partially explain the differences in the pattern of responses given by the two methods. The findings have very important implications for research design and data interpretation. It rejects the null hypothesis that results of risk behaviour studies are independent of the mode of data collection. The conclusion casts considerable doubts on interviewer administered risk behaviour surveys via telephone interviews. The results of risk behaviour surveys should therefore be reviewed and interpreted critically, with special attention given to the mode of data collection. The implications should not only be limited to HIV/STD studies but should be highly relevant to other studies asking sensitive questions. Another very interesting observation is that the differences of response bias may be gender dependent. For instance, the question on whether one had undergone an HIV antibody test in the past 6 months was asked to both the male and the female respondents, using exactly the same wording. However, statistical significance was observed in the female sample but not in the male sample. The multiplicative interaction between the mode of data collection and gender to determine the frequency of HIV testing was of statistical significance (test of homogeneity, ? 2 = 7.507, df = 1, p = 0.006). In other words, the strength of the association between reporting HIV testing and data collection methods was different between the male and the female populations. As the underlying cause of the differences in responses (or reporting bias) may be related to perceived social desirability of the given answers, and since different societies have different norms and expectations on its male and female members, it is hence possible that, under some circumstances, the perception of social desirability differs by gender. HIV antibody test may be seen to be associated with the practice of risk behaviour. Since it is much more socially undesirable for a female than a male to practise risk behaviours in the Chinese culture (such as casual sex or commercial sex), it is expected that the pressure to conform with social desirability would be much greater for the female than the male, thus explaining the above mentioned sex differences. Similar sex method interaction was also observed for substance abuse in the past 6 months. The results therefore illustrate the importance of understanding the social context and its cultural impacts on responses to questions on risk behaviours. Again, such is not only limited to HIV/STD studies. Another sex difference was also observed as male TICQM respondents found it easier to complete the questions in part II (only 0.7% started but did not finish part II) than female TICQM respondents (4.6% started but did not complete part II). One possibility is that females may find the questions more sensitive than males and were less willing to answer such questions. When using the TIM method, respondents might give a false answer to avoid embarrassment. But when the TICQM method was used, there is less need for them to present a false answer as there was no human interaction. Instead, some of them might have chosen to quit the study by hanging up. This presents a limitation to the TICQM method in that it may have a slightly lower completion rate. However, the higher female completion rate in the TIM group should only be accepted with caution, as some of the answers might be false. The suggested sex method interaction, when asking sensitive questions, is an important topic requiring further research efforts. Though the frequencies of risk behaviours and attitudinal responses differed strongly by methods, the percentages of incomplete questionnaires and item non-responses did not. This implies that questionnaire completion rates and number of missing responses were not adequate indicators for assessing performance of different survey methods. Though consistent differences between the two methods have been observed, such differences should not be overstated. It is seen that some, but not all comparisons were significant. In fact, there are more non-significant than significant comparisons found among the male respondents. Further research efforts to understand factors affecting the differences in results between different methods are required. The results of this study strongly remind HIV/STD researchers, and others studying sensitive behaviours and/or attitudes, that they should pay very careful attention to the problem of reporting bias and give all possible efforts to reduce such biases. Innovative data collection methods should also be devised and shared by the community of researchers. The design presented by this study should have wide applications as telephone surveys are quite commonly used in the study of sexual behaviour. Key messages The results of research studies using interviewers and telephone survey methods to collect sensitive personal data, such as those related to HIV/STD, should be interpreted with extreme care, as they are method dependent. When results of different studies are compared, the data collection method should also be taken into account when the data are interpreted. A new method combining interviewer administration and prerecorded computerised questioning reports higher frequencies of risk behaviours, which are likely to be subjected to social desirability effects and reporting bias. Such is especially true for female respondents. The difference is explained by an enhanced perception of confidentiality and anonymity when the new method of the study was used. This method should be applicable in different countries. It should be noted that the extent of reporting bias, which is likely to be related to social norms, may be gender specific. The pressure on females may be larger than that on males in some traditional societies, such as the Chinese ones. Therefore, the between method differences are expected to be more drastic for females than males, as observed in this study. Additional care and attention should hence be given when studying subpopulations (such as females) that are under stronger social pressure to reveal their risk behaviours. Cultural context should always be taken into account. Completion rate and item response rates may not be good indicators to evaluate different types of data collection methods.

"FIND US ON Low-intensity laser delivers high-end results "" The wonderful thing about dentistry is that there 's always something new being studied or developed to improve the patient experience , deliver better results , or both , "" observes Michael J. Andersen , DDS . One innovation that Dr. Andersen introduced to his practice last year is the diode laser . This low-intensity light source allows him to treat the soft tissue of the gums and mouth with gentleness and thoroughness , while reducing blood loss and speeding healing . Dr. Andersen explains that the diode laser replaces two instruments used to make incisions on gum tissue : the scalpel and the electro-surge . "" The scalpel offers great precision , but cutting into gum tissue causes a wound that bleeds and often results in a painful healing period , "" he describes . "" If a patient needs a crown that requires a reduction in gum tissue , the bleeding can interfere with our ability to take an accurate impression of the tooth being treated . The diode laser allows me to ' brush ' the gum tissue with light waves , reducing the tissue without pain and without blood loss , so an impression is easier and quicker to acquire , and recovery is much quicker and more comfortable . "" An electro-surge also makes incisions in gum tissue , but uses electrical current that requires the patient to be "" grounded "" against electrical shock . The device can not be used near conductive materials like metal crowns , implants , or fillings because of the risk of arcing . Other uses Dr. Andersen adds that in orthodontic work , it is often necessary to reduce the space between teeth . This compresses the gum tissue in those spaces , causing it to appear puffed up or bulgy . "" I can use the diode laser to reduce the bulging tissue between the teeth to give it a more natural appearance without triggering a sensitive reaction , "" he says . "" A small amount of peroxide will clean the area and by the time a patient gets home after the appointment , the gum tissue looks and feels comfortable . Within a day or two , the appearance is completely natural . "" A diode laser is also a benefit for patients who need a frenectomy , or a reduction of the fibrous muscle under the lip over the front teeth . In some patients , this muscle is exceptionally strong and pulls the gums forward , away from the teeth . The pull of this muscle can even cause the front teeth to separate . "" In the past , we had to numb the area thoroughly , clamp the muscle off , use a scalpel to cut it , then place sutures to close the resulting wound , "" says Dr. Andersen . "" It could take up to two-and-a-half weeks to heal . With the diode laser , we can use a topical anesthetic , ' cut ' the muscle back , and finish without placing a single suture . The area may be sensitive for about a day , but after that there is no discomfort . "" One of the newest uses for the diode laser is in the treatment of periodontal disease . Stronger lasers have been used for several years in tooth root planing and scaling to treat bacteria embedded in the deep ' pockets ' in the gums surrounding the teeth . The process left the mouth sensitive , and there was always a certain amount of bacteria left behind . Dr. Andersen and Staff "" Using a diode laser to reach deep into the pocket after root planing and scaling , we do n't actually cut into the tissue but rather guide this more gentle laser to sterilize the pocket , "" informs Dr. Andersen . "" Then , we use a special attachment to the diode laser that allows us to use the light energy to warm the surrounding gum tissue , which increases circulation and speeds the healing process . "" The diode laser can also be used to help decontaminate the wound bed of a cold sore or canker sore on the lips or in the mouth . This reduces the sensitivity usually associated with mouth ulcers and reduces healing time . "" This treatment needs to be applied before the ulcer begins to heal on its own , or the laser will simple reopen the wound , "" cautions Dr. Andersen . "" But when these sores are just developing and open , the diode laser offers a real benefit in pain reduction and healing time . "" I have been using the diode laser with great success for some time , now , for a variety of applications , and I 've found it to be an excellent advance for keeping my patients more comfortable when tissue has to be reduced or when certain surgical procedures need to be performed .

It's actually more of an information booklet than an invitation, which would be useful for your wedding guests. It has cruise info, wedding date info and party back home info. The message in a bottle is what we're using for our party back home. This is to inform people that we're going abroad and how, when & where they can celebrate with us.

We request the pleasure of your company to celebrate our marriage: FOOD AND DRINK A complimentary cocktail will be served on arrival, along with wedding cake and cupcakes throughout the evening.

"The environment has four major components : the air , the land , the water and the living organisms which inhabit it . Scientists have given special names for each by creating words based on Greek vocabulary . The first component of the environment is called the atmosphere . The atmosphere contains gases such as nitrogen , oxygen and a small amount of carbon dioxide . The next category of the environment is where all the water is found . It is called the hydrosphere . Bodies of water such as lakes , streams and the oceans form the hydrosphere . The lithosphere is the rock crust of the Earth . The entire planet is covered by the lithosphere , even though most of it has a layer of water on top called the oceans . The last category of the environment is what makes the Earth unique : the biosphere . The biosphere is where all life is found . The Atmosphere Although it is almost entirely invisible , the atmosphere is the easiest part of the Earth's environment to study . Most of the hydrosphere and the lithosphere are difficult to access and remain largely unexplored . The atmosphere , however , has very few mysteries . Just about every cubic metre of it has been observed by scientists or satellites . Johnny's Fact File No. 40 Some Greek words and their meanings "" atmo "" means vapour or air "" hydro "" means water "" litho "" means rock or stone "" bios "" means life Composition of the Air Over 200 years ago , the French scientist Antoine Lavoisier measured the chemical composition of air . Since the gases which make up the atmosphere are invisible , the best way to visualize them is by expressing them as percentages and by using a pie chart . It is important to note that oxygen gas , whose chemical symbol is 0 2 , is not the main component of air and that carbon dioxide , C0 2 , represents much less than one percent . You can see the apparatus Lavoisier used to measure the atmosphere at the Musée des arts et Métiers in Paris Ultraviolet Radiation and Heat Even though it is invisible , the atmosphere is very important for life on this planet . First of all , the atmosphere protects the surface from too much ultraviolet radiation . Ultraviolet radiation , or UV radiation , is a type of energy from the sun which , in high doses , can be dangerous for living organisms . UV radiation is responsible for giving people sun burns . Too much of it causes skin cancer . The atmosphere protects the Earth's surface in two ways . The first way is that gases in the atmosphere are capable of absorbing certain types of radiation , like a sponge absorbs water . The second way is by reflecting radiation in the same way that a mirror reflects light . As a result , very little UV radiation from the Sun ever gets to the Earth's surface . Heat , another type of energy , is absorbed or reflected by the gases in the atmosphere . Some of the heat from the Sun is reflected by the atmosphere so that the Earth does not get too hot . At night , the atmosphere prevents the Earth's heat from escaping into space . As a result , the surface does not get too cold at night .",1,1

"ITV , National Heart Forum , NatMags , The Independent , KPMG , Thomson Intermedia , Benchmark Capital , Cobra Beer ITV is believed to be close to appointing its first director of advertising strategy . Nicky Buss , UK client services director of WPP customer marketing giant Research International , has been linked to the role . She was global strategic planning director of WPP's Red Cell Network . The National Heart Forum , an alliance of health , medical and consumer organisations , yesterday ( Monday ) said it was preparing an application for a judicial review against the broadcast regulator , Ofcom , claiming its crackdown on junk food advertising does not go far enough . The heart charity alleges that it is unlawful and unfair of the regulator to exclude bringing in a 9pm watershed for junk food advertising in its ongoing consultation from "" full and fair consideration "" . NatMags has appointed Niall Hogan , former sales director at Emap Interactive , as its first digital ad director . Hogan joins ahead of the launch of websites for Country Living , Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping and six category-branded websites . The Independent's sales for the 16 May issue , guest edited by Bono , were up by more than 30 % , producing its best sale since 9 / 11 , according to editor-in-chief Simon Kelner . The paper has also partnered with Renault and Rough Guide travelbooks to produce a guide to Mediterranean festivals , which it will give away on Saturday . Spending on digital and direct media rose by 22 % year on year in the first three months of 2006 , with the two media now accounting for a quarter of all ad media spend , a study by KPMG and Thomson Intermedia claims . Though traditional media spend fell year on year for the first time in three years , overall ad spend was up 3.2 % . Benchmark Capital , the venture capitalist behind Irish pay-TV group Setanta , eBay , Betfair and MySQL , has invested £ 8m in social networking site Bebo . c om . The site , a rival to News Corp's MySpace . c om , will use the funding to expand the US team and open a London office . Cobra Beer is to target female beer drinkers with a £ 1m integrated ad campaign for its Cobra Lower Cal brand .

"What kind of professional business people can benefit from using a 24-hour message service ? Is it only for Doctor's and Dentist's Offices ? Would other professions benefit from having a live receptionist answer their phone 24 hours a day , 7 days a week ? Let 's take a look at that . The Office is a different place , these days . It 's no longer a big building , with cubby holes , and small partitions . An office nowadays is anywhere you set up your computer , or hold your cell phone . A lot of business people have now moved their offices into their own homes . Most people do n't have room for a receptionist in their bedroom , or kitchen , and would n't be able to afford the full-time salary anyway . But , there are a lot of reasons an answering service would be a workable solution for fields other than medical and dental . Attorneys have streamlined their operations . Many independent lawyers work from their homes . They would benefit by having an off-site receptionist answer their business telephone while they 're in court . The answering service can then text messages to them , and the attorney can respond at a court recess . People in the Real Estate business are also tending to work from their homes . They have to leave their home offices many times a day . They have to show houses to clients , and it would n't be very feasible for them to field calls . Entrepreneurs engage in starting up and running new businesses . Answering services make sense for them because they do n't have to incur the huge expense of another person on their payroll . They can also give the appearance of having an established company , with the off-site , professional receptionist . Entertainment Industry Companies are involved with different projects for limited amounts of time . There is a transitory nature to the business . Having a centralized , inexpensive answering service as their base of communications is a good idea . You never have to pay to move a virtual office . Anyone in the Construction and Landscaping business could cut out the expense of having an office , altogether . They perform their services at different outdoor places , all the time . This would also include Plumbers , Board-up and Glass Companies , and Roofers , etc. Restoration Companies are in a different category all together . They are involved in emergencies . The people who call them are in trouble , and never on a nine-to-five schedule . They need a communication base that is alert 24 hours a day . Security Guard Services is another field where they are never performing their duties at the same place . Therefore , a "" virtual office "" with 24 hour answering services is ideal . Many companies , today , are in the same situation . They do n't need the big offices , anymore . Technology has become advanced enough to allow them freedom . They can cut down on physical space , and the cost thereof . If you want to talk to a 24-hour Live Receptionist and Answering Service , there is one that is based in Los Angeles , called Global Messaging Network . They can answer any question you have , and give you exact prices on services that fit your needs . 800-244-4334 , info@globalmessaging.net , www.globalmessaging.net .",7,2
"Fitting - Sizes - Models : PHN 's come in two models . The smaller UltraLight , and the larger FullSize . There are no "" sizes "" such as one finds when trying on shoes . The type of hat is the determining factor , not the size of the head . Nets are fitted to drape nicely , and protect a full sized adult . When compared to the different size-shape of net required to cover a full size hat vs a baseball cap , the size differential of nets for smaller vs larger people is quite minimal . Many hundreds of PHN's are out there , and so far we 've yet to run across the individual with a noggin so small or so huge that net size is an issue . A 6 ' man has roughly the same size head as a 5 ' woman . Thankfully , our heads are not like her size 6 vs his size 15 feet , and so we enjoy a confidence in PHN's appropriate fit that 's well proven over time . the UltraLight - This is our original head net . Fits trimly over BaseBall caps , or brimmed hats with up to 2-1 / 4 "" brims , such as Boonie Hats , or the Tilley LT5 series , UL's fit correctly over hats measuring under 11 x 13 "" if laid out flat . Substantial effort shows nought to be gained from optimizing a "" BaseBall Cap Only "" fitment . To reduce blousing and enhance edge sealing , the UL features the Viper Cut curved neckline . While UL's will offer good protection worn over the Sunday Afrernoons Adventure Hat , most people prefer the Full Size for it 's roomier feel with this particular hat . While all our nets use the same netting material , UL's feature the lightest elastic and construction UL's upper elastic is easily adjustable , as UL's now feature an upper cord lock device . In the event that this tiny piece is found annoying to sleep on , it 's removal is effortless the FullSize - Fits correctly with about a 3 "" average brim width , or hats measuring up to 13 x 14 "" laid out flat . This would be the majority of Sun Hats , Filson Hats , Outdoor Reaseach hats along the format of their Seattle Sombrero , the Akubra Riverina , and modestly brimmed Cowboy Hats . Also fits nicely over Tilley hats of the LT6 and LT8 varieties . The FS is not terribly obnoxious fitted over smaller hats . If you did not know we made the nicely trim UL model , you 'd be quite content . If one is on the fence ( hat wise ... ) over a UL vs FS fitting , go with the FS . the Sun Hat - XL - I stopped after making several dozens of them . The reality of the situation is that the edge of the brim of huge hats is simply too far away . The result is that when the head is not tilted , this leaves excess yardage of material billowing about ** . The effect can best be summarized as ... "" not good "" . In a perfect world , if there are enough bugs to warrant a headnet , people would opt for a workable hat . ** - a 15 "" dia hat requires a pattern well over FOUR feet wide ! Buying as a Gift , or for a Group ? - Unless your target is a confirmed baseball cap sort of person , your safest bet may be the Full Size , as this will cover the Vast Majority of users , and in the event that it is "" too big "" , there is no tragic loss of style . Protection will be excellent in either case . Returns or exchanges without drama . Toss the offending item back in it 's package , include a note , and mail it to the return address ... Done . If in a time crunch , please drop me a note and we 'll asap pre-handle the issue .",7,2
"I'm just about to start tiling our bathroom, but not sure where to start, my problem is that we have a window that is NOT in the center of the the wall, so should I start from center of window and have even cuts around the window or center of the wall and have the even cuts on the wall at the corners. Another question I have is when tiling around the window do I work my around one side, (say from left to right) or work up in rows from floor to ceiling. I ask the question because I know someone who tiled around their window from floor upwards then worked his way around both sides and met in the middle at the top, and found that his last tile for the top of the window was not lining up and the tile was too small for the space that was left. It was a right cock up. Its hard explain what he did to be honest. Lay the room out however it will look best, if you are left with ugly cuts by centering the window then center the wall. The way i tile a reveal is to start from the floor and tile my way up untill i get to the bottom of the window ten do a column of tiles going up either side of the window and join them at the top, make sure you use a level to check the columns are right and when everything is right carry on with your horizontal rows utill the wall is tiled. make sure you use a straight edge on the front of the tiles to make sure your levels are correct. also make sure your cuts for the window are level on both sides, the top and bottom, don't just do your cuts at whatever angle your window is currently at, this leaves a perfectly square window, leave an overhand of one tile thickness so that when you put your trims in this leaves room for your reveal tiles and adhesive. If the window is out of square pack the difference out with adhesive (this will have to be bagged cement based adhesive as most tubbed adhesive has a maximum bed of 3mm but most bagged adhesive can be used up to about 50mm). Hope that isn't too complicated? Thanks for your reply. I have replaced all the wallboards so everything is nice and square, including the window, I was just a bit confused about doing around the window. As you suggest I will lay things out to see where the cuts will fall best. So when I start, from floor up and reach the window sill should I take a colume up either side of the window ( making sure of good levels both sides) then once at the top tile in over the window meeting in the middle ? This is where a mate of mine went wrong with his, the space left for the tile to fill in over the window was too big for the tile, so he had to move other tiles in that row to make everything fit, but this then threw the lines out. I dont want to make the same mistake. Take your time to plot the tile runs that suit. If necessary lay them out on the floor with spacers in to get an accurate idea of the layout that suits. With careful measurement you can get a good idea how it will work best for you. Laying out a load of tiles might seems a bit laborious but as a bonus you can spot any batch variation in the tiles and swap them around a bit so they do not notice. Thats right, a column each side joining in the middle above the window. Because you are only doing a single tile column you can adjust slightly to allow correct spacing so that the tile in the middle at the head of the window will fit. Complete the courses of tiles to the left and right of the window and then the next tiles that will go in above the window will be a full row from left to right (or right to left) so you won't have to worry about the tile in the middle not fitting. Just make sure you make good use of a spirit level! This ceiling is good all the way round apart from one corner where the ceiling board raises about 1/2 inch . Probably have to cut the one tile in to fit but I think it will stand out too much other option is coving but its a small ensuite so coving may look a bit out of place. ",0,0

"Part 7 Chapter 2 ON Sunday Étienne escaped from the settlement at nightfall . A very clear sky , sprinkled with stars , lit up the earth with the blue haze of twilight . He went down towards the canal , and followed the bank slowly , in the direction of Marchiennes . It was his favourite walk , a grass-covered path two leagues long , passing straight beside this geometrical water-way , which unrolled itself like an endless ingot of molten silver . He never met any one there . But on this day he was vexed to see a man come up to him . Beneath the pale starlight , the two solitary walkers only recognized each other when they were face to face . "" What ! is it you ? "" said Étienne . Souvarine nodded his head without replying . For a moment they remained motionless , then side by side they set out towards Marchiennes . Each of them seemed to be continuing his own reflections , as though they were far away from each other . "" Have you seen in the paper about Pluchart's success at Paris ? "" asked Étienne , at length . "" After that meeting at Belleville , they waited for him on the pavement , and gave him an ovation . Oh ! he 's afloat now , in spite of his sore throat . He can do what he likes in the future . "" The engine-man shrugged his shoulders . He felt contempt for fine talkers , fellows who go into politics as one goes to the bar , to get an income out of phrases . Étienne was now studying Darwin . He had read fragments , summarized and popularized in a five-sou volume ; and out of this ill-understood reading he had gained for himself a revolutionary idea of the struggle for existence , the lean eating the fat , the strong people devouring the pallid middle class . But Souvarine furiously attacked the stupidity of the Socialists who accept Darwin , that apostle of scientific inequality , whose famous selection was only good for aristocratic philosophers . His mate persisted , however , wishing to reason out the matter , and expressing his doubts by an hypothesis : supposing the old society were no longer to exist , swept away to the crumbs ; well , was it not to be feared that the new world would grow up again , slowly spoilt by the same injustices , some sick and others flourishing , some more skilful and intelligent , fattening on everything , and others imbecile and lazy . becoming slaves again ? But before this vision of eternal wretchedness , the engine-man shouted out fiercely that if justice was not possible with man , then man must disappear . For every rotten society there must be a massacre , until the last creature was exterminated . And there was silence again . For a long time , with sunken head , Souvarine walked over the short grass , so absorbed that he kept to the extreme edge , by the water , with the quiet certainty of a sleep-walker on a roof . Then he shuddered causelessly , as though he had stumbled against a shadow . His eyes lifted and his face was very pale ; he said softly to his companion : "" Did I ever tell you how she died ? "" "" Whom do you mean ? "" "" My woman , over there , in Russia . "" Étienne made a vague gesture , astonished at the tremor in his voice and at the sudden desire for confidence in this lad , who was usually so impassive in his stoical detachment from others and from himself . He only knew that the woman was his mistress , and that she had been hanged at Moscow . "" The affair had n ' t gone off , "" Souvarine said , with eyes still vacantly following the white stream of the canal between the bluish colonnades of tall trees . "" We had been a fortnight at the bottom of a hole undermining the railway , and it was not the imperial train that was blown up , it was a passenger train . Then they arrested Annutchka . She brought us bread every evening , disguised as a peasant woman . She lit the fuse , too , because a man might have attracted attention . I followed the trial , hidden in the crowd , for six days . "" His voice became thick , and he coughed as though he were choking . "" Twice I wanted to cry out , and to rush over the people's heads to join her . But what was the good ? One man less would be one soldier less ; and I could see that she was telling me not to come , when her large eyes met mine . "" He coughed again . "" On the last day in the square I was there . It was raining ; they stupidly lost their heads , put out by the falling rain . It took twenty minutes to hang the other four ; the cord broke , they could not finish the fourth . Annutchka was standing up waiting . She could not see me , she was looking for me in the crowd . I got on to a post and she saw me , and our eyes never turned from each other . When she was dead she was still looking at me . I waved my hat ; I came away . "" There was silence again . The white road of the canal unrolled to the far distance , and they both walked with the same quiet step as though each had fallen back into his isolation . At the horizon , the pale water seemed to open the sky with a little hole of light . "" It was our punishment , "" Souvarine went on roughly . "" We were guilty to love each other . Yes , it is well that she is dead ; heroes will be born from her blood , and I no longer have any cowardice at my heart . Ah ! nothing , neither parents , nor wife , nor friend ! Nothing to make my hand tremble on the day when I must take others' lives or give up my own . "" Étienne had stopped , shuddering in the cool night . He discussed no more , he simply said : "" We have gone far ; shall we go back ? "" They went back towards the Voreux slowly , and he added , after a few paces : "" Have you seen the new placards ? "" The Company had that morning put up some more large yellow posters . They were clearer and more conciliatory , and the Company undertook to take back the certificates of those miners who went down on the following day . Everything would be forgotten , and pardon was offered even to those who were most implicated . "" Yes , I 've seen , "" replied the engine-man . "" Well , what do you think of it ? "" "" I think that it 's all up . The flock will go down again . You are all too cowardly . "" Étienne feverishly excused his mates : a man may be brave , a mob which is dying of hunger has no strength . Step by step they were returning to the Voreux ; and before the black mass of the pit he continued swearing that he , at least , would never go down ; but he could forgive those who did . Then , as the rumour ran that the carpenters had not had time to repair the tubbing , he asked for information . Was it true ? Had the weight of the soil against the timber which formed the internal skirt of scaffolding to the shaft so pushed it in that the winding-cages rubbed as they went down for a length of over fifty metres ? Souvarine , who once more became uncommunicative , replied briefly . He had been working the day before , and the cage did , in fact , jar ; the engine-men had even had to double the speed to pass that spot . But all the bosses received any observations with the same irritating remark : it was coal they wanted ; that could be repaired later on . "" You see that is smashing up ! "" Étienne murmured . "" It will be a fine time ! "" With eyes vaguely fixed on the pit in the shadow , Souvarine quietly concluded : "" If it does smash up , the mates will know it , since you advise them to go down again . "" Nine o ' clock struck at the Montsou steeple ; and his companion having said that he was going to bed , he added , without putting out his hand : "" Well , good-bye . I 'm going away . "" "" What ! you 're going away ? "" "" Yes , I 've asked for my certificate back . I 'm going elsewhere . "" Étienne , stupefied and affected , looked at him . After walking for two hours he said that to him ! And in so calm a voice , while the mere announcement of this sudden separation made his own heart ache . They had got to know each other , they had toiled together ; that always makes one sad , the idea of not seeing a person again . "" You 're going away ! And where do you go ? "" "" Over there--I do n't know at all . "" "" But I shall see you again ? "" "" No , I think not . "" They were silent and remained for a moment facing each other without finding anything to say . "" Then good-bye . "" "" Good-bye . "" While Étienne ascended toward the settlement , Souvarine turned and again went along the canal bank ; and there , now alone , he continued to walk , with sunken head , so lost in the darkness that he seemed merely a moving shadow of the night . Now and then he stopped , he counted the hours that struck afar . When he heard midnight strike he left the bank and turned towards the Voreux . At that time the pit was empty , and he only met a sleepy-eyed captain . It was not until two o ' clock that they would begin to get up steam to resume work . First he went to take from a cupboard a jacket which he pretended to have forgotten . Various tools--a drill armed with its screw , a small but very strong saw , a hammer , and a chisel--were rolled up in this jacket . Then he left . But instead of going out through the shed he passed through the narrow corridor which led to the ladder passage . With his jacket under his arm he quietly went down without a lamp , measuring the depth by counting the ladders . He knew that the cage jarred at three hundred and seventy-four metres against the fifth row of the lower tubbing . When he had counted fifty-four ladders he put out his hand and was able to feel the swelling of the planking . It was there . Then , with the skill and coolness of a good workman who has been reflecting over his task for a long time , he set to work . He began by sawing a panel in the brattice so as to communicate with the winding-shaft . With the help of matches , quickly lighted and blown out , he was then able to ascertain the condition of the tubbing and of the recent repairs . Between Calais and Valenciennes the sinking of mine shafts was surrounded by immense difficulties on account of the masses of subterranean water in great sheets at the level of the lowest valleys . Only the construction of tubbings , frameworks jointed like the stays of a barrel , could keep Out the springs which flow in and isolate the shafts in the midst of the lakes , which with deep obscure waves beat against the walls . It had been necessary in sinking the Voreux to establish two tubbings : that of the upper level , in the shifting sands and white clays bordering the chalky stratum , and fissured in every part , swollen with water like a sponge ; then that of the lower level , immediately above the coal stratum , in a yellow sand as fine as flour , flowing with liquid fluidity ; it was here that the Torrent was to be found , that subterranean sea so dreaded in the coal pits of the Nord , a sea with its storms and its shipwrecks , an unknown and unfathomable sea , rolling its dark floods more than three hundred metres beneath the daylight . Usually the tubbings resisted the enormous pressure ; the only thing to be dreaded was the piling up of the neighbouring soil , shaken by the constant movement of the old galleries which were filling up . In this descent of the rocks lines of fracture were sometimes produced which slowly extended as far as the scaffolding , at last perforating it and pushing it into the shaft ; and there was the great danger of a landslip and a flood filling the pit with an avalanche of earth and a deluge of springs . Souvarine , sitting astride in the opening he had made , discovered a very serious defect in the fifth row of tubbing . The wood was bellied out from the framework ; several planks had even come out of their shoulder-pieces . Abundant filtrations , pichoux the miners call them , were jetting out of the joints through the tarred oakum with which they were caulked . The carpenters , pressed for time , had been content to place iron squares at the angles , so carelessly that not all the screws were put in . A considerable movement was evidently going on behind in the sand of the Torrent . Then with his wimble he unscrewed the squares so that another push would tear them all off . It was a foolhardy task , during which he frequently only just escaped from falling headlong down the hundred and eighty metres which separated him from the bottom . He had been obliged to seize the oak guides , the joists along which the cages slid ; and suspended over the void he traversed the length of the cross-beams with which they were joined from point to point , slipping along , sitting down , turning over , simply buttressing himself on an elbow or a knee , with tranquil contempt of death . A breath would have sent him over , and three times he caught himself up without a shudder . First he felt with his hand and then worked , only lighting a match when he lost himself in the midst of these slimy beams . After loosening the screws he attacked the wood itself , and the peril became still greater . He had sought for the key , the piece which held the others ; he attacked it furiously , making holes in it , sawing it , thinning it so that it lost its resistance ; while through the holes and the cracks the water which escaped in small jets blinded him and soaked him in icy rain . Two matches were extinguished . They all be-came damp and then there was night , the bottomless depth of darkness . From this moment he was seized by rage . The breath of the invisible intoxicated him , the black horror of this rain-beaten hole urged him to mad destruction . He wreaked his fury at random against the tubbing , striking where he could with his wimble , with his saw , seized by the desire to bring the whole thing at once down on his head . He brought as much ferocity to the task as though he had been digging a knife into the skin of some execrated living creature . He would kill the Voreux at last , that evil beast with ever-open jaws which had swallowed so much human flesh ! The bite of his tools could be heard , his spine lengthened , he crawled , climbed down , then up again , holding on by a miracle , in continual movement , the flight of a nocturnal bird amid the scaffolding of a belfry . But he grew calm , dissatisfied with himself . Why could not things be done coolly ? Without haste he took breath , and then went back into the ladder passage , stopping up the hole by replacing the panel which he had sawn . That was enough ; he did not wish to raise the alarm by excessive damage which would have been repaired immediately . The beast was wounded in the belly ; we should see if it was still alive at night . And he had left his mark ; the frightened world would know that the beast had not died a natural death . He took his time in methodically rolling up his tools in his jacket , and slowly climbed up the ladders . Then , when he had emerged from the pit without being seen , it did not even occur to him to go and change his clothes . Three o ' clock struck . He remained standing on the road waiting . At the same hour Étienne , who was not asleep , was disturbed by a slight sound in the thick night of the room . He distinguished the low breath of the children , and the snoring of Bonnemort and Maheude ; while Jeanlin near him was breathing with a prolonged flute-like whistle . No doubt he had dreamed , and he was turning back when the noise began again . It was the creaking of a palliasse , the stifled effort of someone who is getting up . Then he imagined that Catherine must be ill . "" I say , is it you ? What is the matter ? "" he asked in a low voice . No one replied , and the snoring of the others continued . For five minutes nothing stirred . Then there was fresh creaking . Feeling certain this time that he was not mistaken , he crossed the room , putting his hands out into the darkness to feel the opposite bed . He was surprised to find the young girl sitting up , holding in her breath , awake and on the watch . "" Well ! why do n't you reply ? What are you doing , then ? "" At last she said : "" I 'm getting up . "" "" Getting up at this hour ? "" "" Yes , I 'm going back to work at the pit . "" Étienne felt deeply moved , and sat down on the edge of the palliasse , while Catherine explained her reasons to him . She suffered too much by living thus in idleness , feeling continual looks of reproach weighing on her ; she would rather run the risk of being knocked about down there by Chaval . And if her mother refused to take her money when she brought it , well ! she was big enough to act for herself and make her own soup . "" Go away ; I want to dress . And do n't say anything , will you , if you want to be kind ? "" But he remained near her ; he had put his arms round her waist in a caress of grief and pity . Pressed one against the other in their shirts , they could feel the warmth of each other 's naked flesh , at the edge of this bed , still moist with the night's sleep . She had at first tried to free herself ; then she began to cry quietly , in her turn taking him by the neck to press him against her in a despairing clasp . And they remained , without any further desires , with the past of their unfortunate love , which they had not been able to satisfy . Was it , then , done with for ever ? Would they never dare to love each other some day , now that they were free ? It only needed a little happiness to dissipate their shame--that awkwardness which prevented them from coming together because of all sorts of ideas which they themselves could not read clearly . "" Go to bed again , "" she whispered . "" I do n't want to light up , it would wake mother . It is time ; leave me . "" He could not hear ; he was pressing her wildly , with a heart drowned in immense sadness . The need for peace , an irresistible need for happiness , was carrying him away ; and he saw himself married , in a neat little house , with no other ambition than to live and to die there , both of them together . He would be satisfied with bread ; and if there were only enough for one , she should have it . What was the good of anything else ? Was there anything in life worth more ? But she was unfolding her naked arms . "" Please , leave me . "" Then , in a sudden impulse , he said in her ear : "" Wait , I 'm coming with you . "" And he was himself surprised at what he had said . He had sworn never to go down again ; whence then came this sudden decision , arising from his lips without thought of his , without even a moment's discussion ? There was now such calm within him , so complete a cure of his doubts , that he persisted like a man saved by chance , who has at last found the only harbour from his torment . So he refused to listen to her when she became alarmed , understanding that he was devoting himself for her and fearing the ill words which would greet him at the pit . He laughed at everything ; the placards promised pardon and that was enough . "" I want to work ; that 's my idea . Let us dress and make no noise . "" They dressed themselves in the darkness , with a thousand precautions . She had secretly prepared her miner's clothes the evening before ; he took a jacket and breeches from the cupboard ; and they did not wash themselves for fear of knocking the bowl . All were asleep , but they had to cross the narrow passage where the mother slept . When they started , as ill luck would have it , they stumbled against a chair . She woke and asked drowsily : "" Eh ! what is it ? "" Catherine had stopped , trembling , and violently pressing Étienne's hand . "" It 's me ; do n't trouble yourself , "" he said . "" I feel stifled and am going outside to breathe a bit . "" "" Very well . "" And Maheude fell asleep again . Catherine dared not stir . At last she went down into the parlour and divided a slice of bread-and-butter which she had reserved from a loaf given by a Montsou lady . Then they softly closed the door and went away . Souvarine had remained standing near the Avantage , at the corner of the road . For half an hour he had been looking at the colliers who were returning to work in the darkness , passing by with the dull tramp of a herd . He was counting them , as a butcher counts his beasts at the entrance to the slaughter-house , and he was surprised at their number ; even his pessimism had not foreseen that the number of cowards would have been so great . The stream continued to pass by , and he grew stiff , very cold , with clenched teeth and bright eyes . But he started . Among the men passing by , whose faces he could not distinguish , he had just recognized one by his walk . He came forward and stopped him . "" Where are you going to ? "" Étienne , in surprise , instead of replying , stammered : "" What ! you 've not set out yet ! "" Then he confessed he was going back to the pit . No doubt he had sworn ; only it could not be called life to wait with folded arms for things which would perhaps happen in a hundred years ; and , besides , reasons of his own had decided him . Souvarine had listened to him , shuddering . He seized him by the shoulder , and pushed him towards the settlement . "" Go home again ; I want you to . Do you understand ? "" But Catherine having approached , he recognized her also . Étienne protested , declaring that he allowed no one to judge his conduct . And the engine-man's eyes went from the young girl to her companion , while he stepped back with a sudden , relinquishing movement . When there was a woman in a man's heart , that man was done for ; he might die . Perhaps he saw again in a rapid vision his mistress hanging over there at Moscow that last link cut from his flesh , which had rendered him free of the lives of others and of his own life . He said simply : "" Go . "" Étienne , feeling awkward , was delaying , and trying to find some friendly word , so as not to separate in this manner . "" Then you 're still going ? "" "" Yes . "" "" Well , give me your hand , old chap . A pleasant journey , and no ill feeling . "" The other stretched out an icy hand . Neither friend nor wife . "" Good-bye for good this time . "" "" Yes , good-bye . "" And Souvarine , standing motionless in the darkness , watched Étienne and Catherine entering the Voreux .",8,8
"The eLearning Innovation Support Unit GCU Digital Video Project Knowledge , Work & Learning OCL International Exchange Programme Cisco networking academy Listen & learn through the web 10 rules of IT security The other September 11th ( 1973 ) C & IT Help Column : Meeting Maker Breaking through the walls It 's a fair cop : The Scottish Centre for Work Based Learning The Scottish Centre for Work Based Learning ( SCWBL ) has just had an arresting encounter with Strathclyde Police . No , it is not what you think . The Strathclyde Police Training College , based in Jackton near East Kilbride , has just agreed to a work based learning programme in training and learning for its staff of police trainers . This will be entirely designed and delivered by the SCWBL . The college recruits police officers who are at the leading edge of their specialism to train other police officers - in ICT , for example . These trainers stay on average three years in the college before returning to normal duties . So there is constant movement of officers ( or students as we would now like to call them ) . The intention is to make the work based learning programme compulsory guaranteeing a healthy supply of students . The officers have a qualification up to level two , so by undertaking six modules at level three with Glasgow Caledonian University over their stay at Jackton , they will be able to graduate with a general degree . The curriculum will cover : Personal and Professional Development ; Teaching and Learning ; Leadership , Motivation and Group Dynamics ; Curriculum Development including Training Needs Analysis ; Quality and Evaluation and Organisational Culture and Change . Supporting materials will be available in paper based format for use during workshops . However , for those unable to attend workshops , or perhaps as well as for use during workshops , materials will also be available on the University's online managed learning environment system - Blackboard . The online materials will also include additional materials such as websites , further reading , student activities and formative assessments . One important aspect of the course from the Police Force's point of view is that Diversity - equal opportunities awareness - will run through all the materials and all the assessments . John Queen who has been working with the Strathclyde Police for some time on the TLTM programme and Alison Nimmo who provided exemplar materials for the discussions with the police force are delighted with the decision of the police . They are looking forward to supporting the first cohort of students / officers when they begin the course in April this year .

"Why Care About Weatherproofing Your Footwear ? The leather of your shoe can usually withstand several thousands of flexes . However , when it encounters water , it loses its suppleness and this has an impact on the life of the shoe . Leather comes from animal skin and hence , comprises fat and proteins that retain a set amount of moisture after being tanned . The fibres that criss-cross each other in the corium give leather its unique strength . However , they are also prone to drying out and cracking if neglected . Thus , minimise rapid influxes , releases of moisture and exposure to acids or alkaline solutions . The last point is particularly worth emphasising as acids and alkaline solutions can damage the leather permanently . Additionally , salt and other harsh chemicals can leave stains on leather . Once they permeate the leather , they can be very difficult to remove . Thereafter , they will discolour and weaken the top layers of the shoe and eventually end up damaging the finish . The best remedy for this is a simple layer of wax polish that will act as the buffer between the leather and these harmful elements . How to Make Your Shoes Water Resistant Select a Waterproofing Compound Wax-based Polishes : Shoe pastes and creams only nourish the leather . Wax-based polishes create a shine and in doing so , create a thin protective layer that provides light resistance to water and salt . When availing of this option , ensure consistent application after every few wears or if the weather is hostile , after every wear . Specialty Waterproof Compounds : These compounds have a longer sticking period than polishes , when applied properly . Unlike polishes , these compounds seal out the moisture and can be used in conjunction with a polish , once the seal has been set . Spray-on Waterproofing Compounds : Water and stain protectors produced by many companies are safe for use on leather and suede . They usually dry up in 30 minutes and can be worn after the specified time is over . However , they should be used liberally as they lose their efficacy after a few wears . They merely form a protective coat on the leather and do not permeate it . Test and Prepare for Waterproofing For any shoe that is not black in colour , ensure that the compound chosen does not change the shoe's appearance . Do not be misled by the manufacturer's claims that the waterproofing compound does not alter the shoe's colour . Remove the laces of the shoe and clean the shoe thoroughly with a rag and a brush , rendering it free from dirt . Choose an area of the shoe that is not particularly exposed such as the shoe's tongue , under the laces . Apply a small amount of the compound and see how it reacts . If the reaction is satisfactory , apply the compound to another area like the inner back of the shoe . Apply the Water Resistant Compound Evenly and Ensure a Barrier is Formed The sole difference between a waterproof compound and a shining compound application is the attention you should pay to forming an unbroken seal . When shining your shoes , spot shining is an option . However , when waterproofing them , you need to ensure that a water tight barrier is formed if the process is to prove effective . Choose the Right Men's Footwear Beater Shoes : Some men wear shoes that they do n't care about when stepping out into adverse weather conditions . However , this does n't prove to be effective when they need to look professional . We recommend that you have the right equipment than have a pair of shoes , whose sole purpose is to be left to face the vagaries of the weather . Specialty Footwear : Solid footwear made of water-resistant materials such as gortex , synthetic leathers and non-slip rubber soles is commonly available nowadays . Their style design and durability make them practical favourites among men , even though they do not offer as much protection as galoshes . Boots : Boots can be used for a variety of purposes from hiking to work and are a great choice for dealing with inclement weather , since they protect the ankles and can reach up to knee-height as well . They can not be worn with a variety of outfits or men's suits and anything dressier than odd trousers would appear awkward . The dress boot has a wider range and can be worn with a tailor made men's suit ; however , it provides lesser protection than an actual pair of boots since it has a more delicate sole and a smaller heel . These can not traverse through puddles and hence , dress boots need to be treated as well as dress shoes . Boots , however , need to be regularly treated with waterproofing compounds depending on the wearer's environment and the frequency of use . Galoshes : These are rubber footwear that slip over shoes and protect them from the elements and include both over-shoes and over-boots . Since they encapsulate the feet completely , the feet remain dry . Additionally , they also provide excellent traction . The downsides to galoshes are that they need to fit properly and it can take some time to get used to the additional weight they bear . Measures to Take When Your Shoes Are Already Wet Pull the moisture from inside of the shoe using a small dry towel or even a newspaper . Draw the moisture out and replace the moist paper with dry paper , on an hourly basis . Let the shoes dry at room temperature rather than placing them near a source of heat . Heating them can cause the moisture to leave too quickly , thereby leading to the development of cracks on the leather . Cracks on leather can never be fixed . Once the shoes are dry and no further moisture is being drawn from within the shoe , clean and condition the shoe with a leather balm or cream and polish them normally .",2,2

"1 School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1772, USA, 2 Department of Preventive Medicine, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794-8036, USA Correspondence to: J E Enstrom Accepted 7 March 2003 Abstract Objective To measure the relation between environmental tobacco smoke, as estimated by smoking in spouses, and long term mortality from tobacco related disease. Design Prospective cohort study covering 39 years. Setting Adult population of California, United States. Participants 118 094 adults enrolled in late 1959 in the American Cancer Society cancer prevention study (CPS I), who were followed until 1998. Particular focus is on the 35 561 never smokers who had a spouse in the study with known smoking habits. Results For participants followed from 1960 until 1998 the age adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for never smokers married to ever smokers compared with never smokers married to never smokers was 0.94 (0.85 to 1.05) for coronary heart disease, 0.75 (0.42 to 1.35) for lung cancer, and 1.27 (0.78 to 2.08) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among 9619 men, and 1.01 (0.94 to 1.08), 0.99 (0.72 to 1.37), and 1.13 (0.80 to 1.58), respectively, among 25 942 women. No significant associations were found for current or former exposure to environmental tobacco smoke before or after adjusting for seven confounders and before or after excluding participants with pre-existing disease. No significant associations were found during the shorter follow up periods of 1960-5, 1966-72, 1973-85, and 1973-98. Conclusions The results do not support a causal relation between environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality, although they do not rule out a small effect. The association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker than generally believed. Introduction Several major reviews have determined that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke increases the relative risk of coronary heart disease, based primarily on comparing never smokers married to smokers with never smokers married to never smokers. The American Heart Association, the California Environmental Protection Agency, and the US surgeon general have concluded that the increase in coronary heart disease risk due to environmental tobacco smoke is 30% (relative risk 1.30). 1 -- 3 Meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have reported summary relative risks (95% confidence intervals) of 1.30 (1.22 to 1.38), 1.25 (1.17 to 1.32), and 1.25 (1.17 to 1.33) for coronary heart disease 4 -- 6 and 1.23 (1.13 to 1.35) and 1.23 (1.13 to 1.34) for lung cancer, 7 8 similar to the 1.20 found by the California Environmental Protection Agency and the US surgeon general. 2 3 The US Environmental Protection Agency has classified environmental tobacco smoke as a known human carcinogen. 7 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, primarily asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema, has been associated with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, but the evidence for increased mortality is sparse. 2 3 Although these reviews come to similar conclusions, the association between environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related diseases is still controversial owing to several limitations in the epidemiological studies. 9 -- 14 Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is difficult to measure quantitatively and therefore has been approximated by self reported estimates, primarily smoking history in spouses. Confounding by active cigarette smoking is so strong that the association with environmental tobacco smoke can only be evaluated among never smokers. The relation between tobacco related diseases and environmental tobacco smoke may be influenced by misclassification of some smokers as never smokers, misclassification of exposure status to environmental tobacco smoke, and several potential confounders. It is also unclear how the reported increased risk of coronary heart disease due to environmental tobacco smoke could be so close to the increased risk due to active smoking (30% and 70%, respectively), since environmental tobacco smoke is much more dilute than actively inhaled smoke. Most epidemiological studies have found that environmental tobacco smoke has a positive but not statistically significant relation to coronary heart disease and lung cancer. Meta-analyses have combined these inconclusive results to produce statistically significant summary relative risks. 4 -- 8 However, there are problems inherent in using meta-analysis to establish a causal relation. 9 -- 14 The epidemiological data are subject to the limitations described above. They have not been collected in a standardised way, and some relative risks have been inappropriately combined. Because it is more likely that positive associations get published, unpublished negative results could reduce the summary relative risks. Also, the meta-analyses of coronary heart disease omitted the published negative results from the large American Cancer Society cancer prevention study (CPS I). 10 11 We have extended the follow up for the California participants in this cohort, analysed the relation between environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related diseases, and addressed concerns about this study. Methods CPS I is a prospective cohort study begun by the American Cancer Society in October 1959 and described in detail elsewhere. 15 -- 17 A total of 1 078 894 adults from 25 states were enrolled on the basis of a detailed four page questionnaire. In 1961, 1963, 1965, and 1972, surviving cohort members completed brief questionnaires. The American Cancer Society ascertained the vital status and current address for most of the adults up to September 1972 and obtained death certificates for most of those known dead. Follow up Long term follow up was undertaken at the University of California at Los Angeles on all 118 094 participants from California. This is described in detail elsewhere and summarised in table 1 . 18 The participants were matched several times with the California death file and the social security death index on the basis of their name and other identifying variables. 18 19 Overall, 79 437 deaths were identified up to 31 December 1998, and the underlying cause was obtained from the California death file and death certificates for 93% (73 876) of these deaths. Participants were also matched with information given on their California driver's licence, based primarily on name, date of birth, and height. We obtained the address given during the 1990s for 21 897 participants who were not known as dead as of 1999, and these participants were assumed to be alive in 1999. Of the remaining participants in the study's master database, 6845 were withdrawn from further follow up as of September 1972 because their complete name was not retained, and 9915 were lost to follow up as of 1999 because their vital status was unknown. To assess the current status of surviving cohort members, in mid-1999 we sent out a two page questionnaire on smoking and lifestyle to those participants with an address for 1995 or later on their driver's licence. Overall, 2290 of 5275 men (43.4%) and 4869 of 10 738 women (45.3%) completed the questionnaire. Responses to name, date of birth, and height on the questionnaire confirmed that over 99% of the respondents had been accurately located. The follow up period was from time of entry to the study (1 January to 31 March 1960) until death, withdrawal (date last known alive), or end of follow up (31 December 1998). The participants were aged 30-96 years at enrolment. We excluded the few person years of observation and the 36 deaths during 1959. The underlying cause of each death was assigned according to the international classification of diseases (seventh, eighth, or ninth revisions). Coronary heart disease was defined as 420 (ICD-7) during 1960-7, 410-4 (ICD-8) during 1968-78, and 410-4 (ICD-9) during 1979-98, lung cancer was defined as 162-3 (ICD-7), 162 (ICD-8), and 162 (ICD-9), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was defined as 241, 500-2, and 527.1 (ICD-7), 490-3 (ICD-8), and 490-6 (ICD-9). For the analysis of environmental tobacco smoke we selected the 35 561 participants who had never smoked as of 1959 and who had a spouse in the study with known smoking habits. Statistical analysis The independent variable used for analysis was exposure to environmental tobacco smoke based on smoking status of the spouse in 1959, 1965, and 1972. Never smokers married to current or former smokers were compared with never smokers married to never smokers. The 1959 never smokers were defined as those who had never smoked any form of tobacco as of 1959. The 1965 never smokers were defined as 1959 never smokers who did not smoke cigarettes as of 1965. The 1972 never smokers were defined as 1959 never smokers who did not smoke cigarettes as of 1965 and 1972. The 1959/1999 never smokers were defined as 1959 never smokers who had never smoked cigarettes as of 1999. Never smokers married to a current smoker were subdivided into categories according to the smoking status of their spouse: 1-9, 10-19, 20, 21-39, ?40 cigarettes consumed per day for men and women, with the addition of pipe or cigar usage for women. Former smokers were considered as an additional category. We calculated the age adjusted relative risk of death and 95% confidence interval as a function of smoking status of the spouse by using Cox proportional hazards regression. 18 20 A fully adjusted relative risk was calculated by using a model that included age and seven potential confounders at baseline: race (white, non-white), education level (&lt; 12, 12, &gt; 12 years), exercise (none or slight, moderate, heavy), body mass index (&lt; 20, 20-22.99, 23-25.99, 26-29.99, ?30), urbanisation (five population sizes), fruit or fruit juice intake (0-2, 3-4, 5-7 days a week), and health status (good, fair, poor, sick). Analyses were carried out for all participants and for healthy participants (those with no history of cancer, heart disease, or stroke at baseline). The relative risk was also calculated for current cigarette smokers (cigarettes only) as a function of number of cigarettes consumed per day for the entire cohort. 18 For reference, the age adjusted death rate has been calculated by cause of death for all never smokers. 18 Results The personal and lifestyle characteristics and follow up status for 1959 never smokers were relatively independent of their spouse's smoking status (tables 2 and 3 ). Also, the baseline characteristics of the 1999 respondents in 1959 were similar to those for all participants in 1959, except for a younger age at enrolment. Although heavily censored by age, the 1999 respondents seemed reasonably representative of survivors. Race, education, exercise, height, weight, and fruit intake had also remained largely unchanged among the 1999 respondents since 1959. The proportion of participants who had withdrawn as of 1972, were lost as of 1999, or had an unknown cause of death was not related to the smoking status of spouses. However, widowhood (widowed as of 1999) increased substantially with the level of smoking in the spouse. The smoking status of spouses as of 1959 was related to three self reported measures of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke as of 1999 ( table 4 ). Particularly for women, there was a clear relation between smoking status of spouses as of 1959 and self reported measures in 1999 of having lived with a smoker, having lived with a smoking spouse, and a positive answer to the question ""In your work or daily life, are (were) you regularly exposed to cigarette smoke from others"" Also, the percentage of participants currently married as of 1999 declined substantially with the smoking status of the spouse, owing to increased widowhood. Smoking history of the spouse as assessed in 1999 was strongly related to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke as of 1999 for both men and women ( table 5 ). Percentage of cohort exposed to three measures of environmental tobacco smoke in 1999 by smoking status of spouse among 1959 never smokers who responded to 1999 follow up questionnaire. Subgroup of 1959 never smokers aged ?50 years at entry (born before 1910) also shown. Values are percentage (number) exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in 1999, except for data on marital status One measure of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke as of 1999 by smoking history of spouse in 1999 among 1959/1999 never smokers who responded to 1999 follow up questionnaire. Values are percentage (number) exposed to environmental tobacco smoke in 1999 Misclassification of exposure and smoking status Although there was substantial misclassification of environmental tobacco smoke exposure status from 1959 to 1999, it was less for those never smokers aged 50 or over at enrolment (see table 4 ), never smokers defined in 1972 (data not shown), and never smokers defined in 1999 (see table 5 ). Misclassification of exposure status produces a measured relative risk that is closer to 1.0 than the true relative risk. 8 13 The extent of misclassification from 1959 to 1999 could not obscure a true association with a relative risk of about 1.3, if it exists, among women, but it could largely obscure this association among men. However, this level of misclassification, which is based on the changes that occurred over 40 years among the younger than average 1999 respondents, exaggerates the true level of misclassification that occurred among the cohort as a whole, particularly during short follow up periods. Essentially all 1959 never smokers remained never smokers on the basis of smoking status reported in 1965, 1972, and 1999 ( table 6 ). Of those who reported a history of smoking in 1999, most had smoked no more than 10 cigarettes per day for a few years, and most had quit smoking before 1960. This indicates only a small degree of misclassification of smoking status. Some bias exists in the misclassification of smoking status among the 1959 never smokers, because the percentage who smoked in the 1965 and 1972 surveys was greatest among those with the highest levels of smoking in spouses. This bias produces a measured relative risk that is greater than the true relative risk, but by a negligible amount for this level of bias. 8 13 Percentage of current smokers by cigarettes consumed per day as of 1965, 1972, and 1999, and former smokers by year of cessation as of 1999 among 1959 never smokers by smoking status of spouse. Values are percentages (numbers) of cigarette smokers Effect of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke was not significantly associated with the death rate for coronary heart disease, lung cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in men or women (tables 7 and 8 ). This was true for all 1959 never smokers and 1959 never smokers aged 50 or over at enrolment followed during 1960-98 and for 1972 never smokers followed during 1973-98. The relative risks were slightly reduced after adjustment for seven confounders. Results were essentially unchanged among the healthy participants only (data not shown). The relative risks were consistent with 1.0 for virtually every level of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, current or former. Only the relative risks for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease suggested an association. An environmental tobacco smoke index based on seven or eight levels of smoking in a spouse yielded a relative riskof about 1.0 for each level of change and no suggestion of a dose-response trend.

For reference, 1960-98 death rate in deaths per 1000 person years adjusted to 1960 US population for attained ages 35-84 is given 18 In addition, analyses for coronary heart disease were performed for three short follow up periods with presumably smaller misclassification errors. All relative risks for coronary heart disease were consistent with 1.0 for the follow up periods of 1960-5, 1966-72, and 1973-85 for never smokers defined as of 1959, 1965, and 1972 ( table 9 ). In particular, the relative risk for current smoking in a spouse was not increased, and there were no trends based on the environmental tobacco smoke index. Level of smoking in spouse and deaths from coronary heart disease among never smokers in California cancer prevention study (CPS I) cohort, as of 1959, 1965, and 1972 As expected, there was a strong, positive dose-response relation between active cigarette smoking and deaths from coronary heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during 1960-98 ( table 10 10 ). These relative risks were consistent with those for the full CPS I cohort until 1972. 15 17 As it is generally considered that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is roughly equivalent to smoking one cigarette per day, 4 we extrapolated the relative risk due to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke from the relative risks for smoking 1-9 cigarettes per day. These extrapolated relative risks were about 1.03 for coronary heart disease and about 1.20 for lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Based on these findings, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke could not plausibly cause a 30% increase in risk of coronary heart disease in this cohort, although a 20% increase in risk of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could not be ruled out. 1960-98 age adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) of death for coronary heart disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among cigarette smokers compared with never smokers as function of active smoking status (cigarettes per day) in 1959 Discussion On the basis of our findings from the long term follow up of the California cohort of the cancer prevention study (CPS I), the association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease and lung cancer may be considerably weaker than generally believed. Although participants in CPS I are not a representative sample of the US population, never smokers in this cohort had a total death rate that was close to that of US white never smokers. 21 Furthermore, the relative risks were based on comparisons within the cohort and should be valid. Although the participants' total exposure to smoking in a spouse was affected by the substantial extent of smoking cessation since 1959, 18 this did not affect the relative comparisons. Also, the relative risks during short follow up periods, with limited cessation, were similar to the long term risks. Strengths of study CPS I has several important strengths: long established value as a prospective epidemiological study, large size, extensive baseline data on smoking and potential confounders, extensive follow up data, and excellent long term follow up. None of the other cohort studies on environmental tobacco smoke has more strengths, and none has presented as many detailed results. Considering these strengthsas a whole, the CPS I cohort is one of the most valuable samples for studying therelation between environmental tobacco smoke and mortality. Concern has been expressed that smoking status of the spouse as of 1959 does not accurately reflect total exposure to environmental tobacco smoke because there was so much exposure to non-residential environmental tobacco smoke at that time. 6 The 1999 questionnaire showed that the smoking status of spouses was directly related to a history of total exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. It also showed that the extent of misclassification of exposure was not sufficient to obscure a true association between environmental tobacco smoke and coronary heart disease among women (see tables 4 and 5 ). Our methodology and results are fully described because of concern that the earlier analysis of coronary heart disease in CPS I 10 was flawed by author bias owing to funding by the tobacco industry. 4 Our results for coronary heart disease and lung cancer are consistent with those of most of the other individual studies on environmental tobacco smoke, 4 -- 8 including the results for coronary heart disease and lung cancer in the full CPS I. 10 16 Moreover, when our results are included in a meta-analysis of all results for coronary heart disease, the summary relative risks for current and ever exposure to environmental tobacco smoke are reduced to about 1.05, indicating a weak relation. Widowhood was strongly correlated with smoking status of spouses, owing to the reduced survival of smokers. Since widowers have higher death rates than married people, 22 23 controlling for widowhood would be expected to reduce the relative risks in this and other studies of smoking in spouses. The precise effect of widowhood due to smoking in spouses still needs to be determined, but it may partially explain the positive relative risks found in other cohorts. Conclusion The results of the California CPS I cohort do not support a causal relation between exposure to environental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality, although they do not rule out a small effect. Given the limitations of the underlying data in this and the other studies of environmental tobacco smoke and the small size of the risk, it seems premature to conclude that environmental tobacco smoke causes death from coronary heart disease and lung cancer. What is already known on this topic Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is generally believed to increase the risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer among never smokers by about 25% This increased risk, based primarily on meta-analysis, is still controversial due to methodological problems What this study adds In a large study of Californians followed for 40 years, environmental tobacco smoke was not associated with coronary heart disease or lung cancer mortality at any level of exposure These findings suggest that the effects of environmental tobacco smoke, particularly for coronary heart disease, are considerably smaller than generally believed Acknowledgments We thank Lawrence Garfinkel and Clark W Heath Jr (former vice presidents for epidemiology and statistics, American Cancer Society) for facilitating the extended follow up of CPS I and for making helpful comments and suggestions and Saman Assefi and Parveen Sra for technical assistance. Footnotes Contributors JEE conceived the study and obtained funding, conducted the extended follow up, analysed the data, and drafted the manuscript; he will act as guarantor for the paper. GCK contributed to the follow up questionnaire, advised on the data analysis and interpretation, and contributed extensively to the manuscript. Funding The American Cancer Society initiated CPS I in 1959, conducted follow up until 1972, and has maintained the original database. Extended follow up until 1997 was conducted at the University of California at Los Angeles with initial support from the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, a University of California research organisation funded by the Proposition 99 cigarette surtax ( www.ucop.edu/srphome/trdrp ). After continuing support from the Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program was denied, follow up through 1999 and data analysis were conducted at University of California at Los Angeles with support from the Center for Indoor Air Research, a 1988-99 research organisation that received funding primarily from US tobacco companies. 24 Competing interests In recent years JEE has received funds originating from the tobacco industry for his tobacco related epidemiological research because it has been impossible for him to obtain equivalent funds from other sources. GCK never received funds originating from the tobacco industry until last year, when he conducted an epidemiological review for a law firm which has several tobacco companies as clients. He has served as a consultant to the University of California at Los Angeles for this paper. JEE and GCK have no other competing interests. They are both lifelong non-smokers whose primary interest is an accurate determination of the health effects of tobacco. ",1,1

"On 31 August 2012, Tom Holland responded to the many complaints Channel 4 had received with regards to his recent documentary ""Islam: The Untold Story"" [1]. He made a number of points in his defence and the most important of them will be addressed below. Holland's words will be in bold italics and our response will follow his statements. He stated in his response: 'The origins of Islam are a legitimate subject of historical enquiry...' We agree and this legitimate enquiry should continue. We applaud and appreciate the efforts of any sincere, honest and objective scholar in this regard. In fact Muslims were the first people to scrutinise their own historical tradition and came up a systematic method to do so: ilm ul hadith (the Science of Hadith). Thousands of early Muslim authorities have put a tremendous amount of time and effort to ensure an unadulterated authentic transmission of the prophetic tradition to subsequent generations. We invite Holland to pay more attention to the science of Hadith and a number of works have been written in the English language for him to peruse. 'We were of course aware when making the programme that we were touching deeply-held sensitivities and went to every effort to ensure that the moral and civilizational power of Islam was acknowledged in our film, and the perspective of Muslim faith represented, both in the persons of ordinary Bedouin in the desert, and one of the greatest modern scholars of Islam, Seyyed Hossein Nasr.' Here Holland suggests that ""ordinary Bedouin"" were the right people to represent the intricate details of Islamic historiography or the Islamic academic position. How could the desert Bedouin present an academic view on the origins of Islam, as they are known to be not very well educated? They certainly do not have access to some of the early dated papyri evidence scattered all over international libraries, which mentions the disciples of the Prophet (peace be upon him). How could the Bedouin contribute to an academic debate at all? Instead of going to people like Patricia Crone and Fred Donner, why didn't Holland visit the local public house to seek advice on matters academic for a non-Muslim perspective, just like he went to the tea drinking Bedouin in the desert to seek opinions on the historical origins of Islam? As for Seyyed Hossein Nasr, he is indeed a very well established academic and has written extensively on Islamic philosophy. But the question is: was he the right person to consult on a specialist subject like the early Islamic history, when we have hundreds of other specialists/academics to deal with the topic? Early Islamic history is a very specific subject and requires a specialist to comment on it. The Nasr Foundation website describes his expertise as follows and early Islamic history is not one of them: 'Professor Nasr speaks and writes with great authority on a wide variety of subjects, ranging from philosophy to religion to spirituality, to music and art and architecture, to science and literature, to civilizational dialogues and the natural environment.' [2] Dr Nasr may well be qualified to speak on Islamic topics but some of the questions posed to him ended with a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. Having seen the biased selection of authorities in this programme, how do we know that Nasr's views were even represented without any necessary editing? While visiting the Bedouin in the desert, Holland should have taken some time to visit some of the academics in Arabia to ask the very questions he was asking Patricia Crone. We are sure he would come away enlightened. Holland further said: 'An accusation laid against the film is one of bias and, although I believe that absolute objectivity is a chimera, what was incumbent upon us, in making the film, was to be up-front about my own ideological background and presumptions, and to acknowledge the very different perspective that Muslim faith provides.' Our view is that Holland's presumptions were historically anachronistic and we have already shown that conclusively in our response. Our response to the documentary presents some relevant crucial primary evidence and quotes from some of the major authorities in the field. Why would Holland deliberately presume the worst, especially when all historical evidence suggests otherwise? 'If the film was about the origins of Islam, then it was also about the tensions between two differing world-views. Whether one accepts or rejects the truth of the tradition is ultimately dependent upon the philosophical presumptions that one brings to the analysis of the sources.' There is no inherent tension between the ""two world views"" as far as the historical enquiry is concerned. Even if one was to accept the dichotomy of ""two world views"", one would come to realise that truth and honesty are virtues common to all world views. Historical enquiry must be based upon truth and the whole truth can never be known until one has all facts explored. The programme utterly failed to take all facts into consideration, as seen from our response to the programme. The film was clearly biased in its presumptions and some of the evident presumptions were the non-existence of contemporary Islamic evidence and the rejection of the Islamic historical tradition. This was shown to be a misconception in our response to the programme. 'It has been suggested that I say in the film that Mecca is not mentioned in the Qu'ran. In fact, I say that Mecca is mentioned once in the Qu'ran. As a historian I have to rely on original texts and although later tradition (as brought to us through the hadith) has come to accept that other names are synonymous with Mecca, the fact is that there is only one mention of Mecca in the Qu'ran (although due to an unwarranted interpolation, a second one does appear in the Pickthall translation).' The Mecca question was one of the most disturbing parts of the programme, as far as historical honesty is concerned. Here is what Holland said in the documentary at 39:20: 'aside from a single ambiguous mention in the Quran itself, there is no mention of Mecca, not one, in any datable text for over a hundred years after Muhammad's death.' How is the reference ambiguous? The mention of Mecca is very explicit and there is only one meaning of the noun i.e. the sacred city where Muhammad (peace be upon him) was born. To suggest that the reference is ambiguous is to deliberately turn a blind eye to established facts. This is the problem with rejecting the Islamic tradition as any meaning and any interpretation, no matter how erroneous, can be entertained. Commenting on the prospect of taking up another explanation for Mecca, Patricia Crone states in the documentary: 'why take it on, well that's what historians do, if things don't fit you try something else that might fit'. Both, Holland and Crone, do not provide any reasons to suspect the historicity of the city of Mecca presented in the Islamic narrative. Holland's reason seems to be ""the absence of evidence is evidence for absence"". But is the evidence absent? Absolutely not, there is more than enough evidence to ascertain the existence of the sacred city of Mecca of the Islamic narrative. By questioning the existence of such a city, Holland is claiming a mass conspiracy on part of the early Muslims. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim pilgrims have been travelling to Mecca from the early days of Islam and this practice never ceased to exist to this day. Before that, thousands of pagans used to visit the city when it was the central place of idol worship in Arabia before Muhammad (peace be upon him) returned it to its Abrahamic origin as a bastion of monotheism. To ask the question whether the Mecca of Islamic tradition existed or not is to ask whether the Arabs of the seventh century were deaf, dumb and blind. Why would hundreds of thousands of people, in the second half of the seventh century, suddenly begin to visit the city of Mecca as a pilgrimage site if they didn't find their predecessors do it? 'On the broad perspective some complaints assert unequivocally, as is often said, that Islam was ""born in the full light of history unlike the ancient faiths"". That may have been the belief of Western scholars back in the days of Ernest Renan, but it is most certainly not the academic consensus today.' We ask Holland: have we yet discovered the full light of history or is there still a lot to discover? We quote Robert Hoyland again to show Holland as to the amount of evidence still in need of serious study: 'The problem of the historiography of this period is certainly a very challenging one, and will remain so while no accepted criteria exist to verify the Muslim literary tradition. And yet there are grounds for optimism. Firstly, we do have a number of bodies of evidence -- especially non-Muslim sources, papyri, inscriptions and archaeological excavations -- that can serve as a useful external referent and whose riches are only just beginning to be exploited in a systematic manner. Secondly, the historical memory of the Muslim community is more robust than some have claimed. For example, many of the deities, kings and tribes of the pre-Islamic Arabs that are depicted by ninth-century Muslim historians also feature in the epigraphic record, as do many of the rulers and governors of the early Islamic state. This makes it difficult to see how historical scenarios that require for their acceptance a total discontinuity in the historical memory of the Muslim community -- such as that Muhammad did not exist, the Quran was not written in Arabic, Mecca was originally in a different place etc. -- can really be justified. Many of these scenarios rely on absence of evidence, but it seems a shame to make such a recourse when there are so many very vocal forms of material evidence still waiting to be studied.' [3] If there is a lot more to be studied, and that is definitely the case, then how can one even think of a consensus? Robert Hoyland provides some of the epigraphic and papyri evidence to suggest that this material evidence actually confirms the authenticity of the Islamic narrative in many regards. Holland, however, simply doesn't seem to be aware of this evidence in the documentary. 'It has also wrongly been suggested that we said there is no historical evidence for the seventh century origins of Islam. What I actually said in the film was that I had expected to find contemporaneous Muslim evidence -- ""but there's nothing there."" And the Qur'an aside, the first mention of the prophet Muhammad's name in Arabic is on the coin that we featured in Part Five, and on the Dome of the Rock, which we also featured prominently. The evidence provided by Christian contemporaries was mentioned in Part Three, and is dealt with at greater length in the book.' Holland has actually confirmed what we claimed he said in our response. He repeats it here again: 'I had expected to find contemporaneous Muslim evidence -- ""but there's nothing there.""' Even though we provided so much contemporaneous evidence in our response, Holland simply failed to acknowledge it again. We presented links to original documents and inscription for Holland (and his likes) to see the evidence in black and white but that doesn't seem to have changed his mind. Here it is again: We will ask Holland again: the inscription of Zuhayr, is it not contemporaneous enough? The papyri documents mentioning 'Amr ibn al 'Aas by name, are they not enough evidence to confirm the authenticity of the Islamic chronology as well as narrative? We invite Holland to look at the contemporaneous evidence in Arabic provided by Robert Hoyland and the Islamic Awareness team on their website and reconsider his position or provide an alternative objective view on this evidence. One cannot simply claim ""there is nothing there"" and ignore piles of evidence in front of him. It is really surprising to see Holland accept a pile of undated stones as valid evidence to support his argument for the existence of an early mosque but when it comes to acknowledging dated contemporary texts that go against his ""presuppositions"", he simply fails to address them in the documentary. As for the mention of Muhammad (peace be upon him), why should we put the Quran aside, which is the biggest source of evidence for the historicity of Muhammad (peace be upon him)? The Quran is a valid form of contemporary evidence, which cannot be ignored. Our view is that if all the available evidence on Islam, excluding the traditional Islamic narrative, is put together it confirms rather than call into question the authenticity of the Islamic traditional narrative. Hence, all epigraphic, numismatic, archaeological, papyri, manuscript and other material evidence in fact confirms the authentic transmission of the Islamic historical tradition. Holland finally stated in the concluding remarks of his response: ""Obviously in a film of only 74 minutes, which opens up very rich and complex arguments and brings to light detailed academic scholarship, which has been going on for over forty years, it is impossible to articulate all the resonances and implications of every argument."" This is why we were shocked to realize Holland's choice of Bedouin to represent the Islamic perspective. In an important 74 minutes long full of ""complex arguments"" and ""academic scholarship"" documentary, Holland should have spent a little more time with Islamic historians instead of wasting all those precious minutes in learning the way of the Bedouin. Undercutting Holland's Revisionist Approach Tom Holland's entire argument rests on a daring presupposition: the rejection of the Islamic historical tradition. The Hadith, which forms a substantial part of the Islamic historical corpus, is one of the most valid sources of history. Holland however rejects the Islamic narrative due to his epistemological bias. He argues that the basis of the Islamic tradition, the chain of transmission (isnad), is not a valid source of knowledge. This perspective is philosophically and historically rogue and cannot be taken seriously. As discussed in our paper, testimony is considered as one of the valid sources of knowledge, and when applied properly it can form justified beliefs. Testimony is a valid source of knowledge only when it comes from a reliable source, especially if there are multiple sources in agreement. Obviously there are conditions as to how we can use testimony, but in the majority cases we consider testimony as a valid source of knowledge. The philosopher C. A. J. Coady in his book 'Testimony: A Philosophical Study' highlights our dependency on testimony and the implications of rejecting it: '...many of us have never seen a baby born, nor have most of us examined the circulation of the blood nor the actual geography of the world nor any fair sample of the laws of the land, nor have we made the observations that lie behind our knowledge that the lights in the sky are heavenly bodies...' [4] Therefore the rejection of testimony would be tantamount to rejecting the existence of Peru or the roundness of the earth. Concerning the Hadith, not only do we have mass testimony of events and statements of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), we have a detailed science dedicated to authenticate these traditions. Prophetic traditions consist of two components: isnad (chain of narration or transmission) and matn (text). Each of these have detailed criteria that scrutinise the chain and the text to a degree that leaves very little room for doubt. Moreover, each Prophetic tradition has been scrutinised more rigorously than any historical fact we have with us today. Thousands of companions of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) narrated reports from him and these reports were then transmitted to subsequent generations with maximum care and authenticity. An anonymous report or a narration originating from an unknown or untrustworthy source was immediately rejected. This method of authentication validates testimony as an acceptable source of knowledge. The emeritus professor of philosophy, Keith Lehrer, in the book 'The Epistemology of Testimony' concludes that testimony provides a valid source of historical information once the 'trustworthiness of others' is 'evaluated'. Lehrer writes: 'The final question that arises concerning our acceptance of testimony is this. What converts our acceptance of testimony of others into knowledge? The first part of the answer is that we must be trustworthy in our evaluations of the trustworthiness of others, and we must accept that this is so. Moreover, our trustworthiness must be successfully truth-connected, that is, the others must, in fact, be trustworthy and their trustworthiness must be truth-connected. We must accept this is so. In short, our acceptance of their testimony must be justified in a way that is not refuted or defeated by any errors that we make in evaluating them and their testimony. Undefeated or irrefutable justified acceptance of the testimony of others is knowledge.'(emphasis added) [5] Holland needs to answer the following questions if he wants his work to be taken seriously: Since authenticated testimony, which forms part of the Islamic historical tradition, is a valid source of knowledge, on what grounds do you reject this well-founded source of history? If you do reject authenticated testimony, are you willing to accept the philosophical and practical absurdities that follow from your unjustified skepticism? Holland's revisionist approach rests on the daring presupposition that authenticated testimony is not a valid source of knowledge. As explained above, this epistemological bias is unfounded and therefore Holland's entire revisionist argument breaks down. In this light, it appears that Holland was not even interested in a serious academic discussion, hence no mention of the Islamic Hadith tradition and its value. He didn't even present a valid reason for not considering the Islamic tradition as a historically valid source of information. Even the contemporary epigraphic evidence was ignored by Holland. Just because the Islamic tradition is religious in nature does not imply it is untrustworthy. Perhaps, Holland's secular outlook prevented him from consulting the most important source of information in this enquiry: the hadith. So long as the Quran is with us, we will continue to believe and worship the Lord of the worlds. It is the Quran that encourages valid intellectual pursuit. The Quran poses existential questions and encourages mankind to question its prejudices. We, the Muslims, are open to any valid debate and pursuit. May God guide us all to that which is true, Amen.

"C-evo Contents C-evo ( a.k.a. Civilization-evolution ) is a free-to-play game similar to Civilization II . The game was written in the Delphi programming language , with the main programming done by Steffen Gerlach . The source code is in the public domain , but the graphics are freeware . A successful player manages to find a balance among these choices . The game starts with the development of the wheel , and ends when the first player has successfully constructed the first off-planet spaceship headed out into the Solar System . As the game progresses , the player finds that the building of factories , for example , leads to increased pollution , which must be cleaned up and could be eliminated through development of cleaner technologies . At all stages , cities that grow larger than size 4 have reduced productivity because of unrest until suitable buildings or police are in place to keep the populace under control . Examining a city screen selected from the cities menu at an advanced stage of the game In addition to the standard AI that comes with C-Evo , a number of different AI's ( programs that play C-Evo ) with different strategies are available for C-Evo ; most of the following links are direct links to the zipped files to download : As with the commercial and the other free civ games , there are a variety of strategies possible , though the ultimate launch of a spaceship is the only way of officially winning . The game goes through several somewhat distinct phases , based on the advances a player has researched : Given that the AIs are supposed to operate in a range of map sizes and unknown environments ( sea / land , hostile / friendly opponents ) they often have different counter-strategies for each ( overlapping ) phase . eXpand - . often an early ( aggressive ) land-grab where each nation tries to stake out as much territory as possible eXchange - given that AIs have same standing as humans , they are allowed to form alliances and trade amongst themselves ( money , tech , unit designs , information ) eXploit - once the terrirtories / borders are firmly established , develop the cities and build an advantage , sometimes polishing off weak opponents if opportunity arises . eXtinguish - the end-game relies on achieving the primary objective of assembling components for a spacecraft and more importantly surviving long enough to do so , which often involves conquering strong enemies . On the C-evo webpage , the game , its source code , AI modules , player contributions such as many additional nations , maps , mods , and utilities are available . The game has an open AI interface , which means the player can replace the standard AI contained in the package with other AI algorithms , either for all nations or for individual nations . The documentation of the AI's DLL-interface is available from the project homepage . There is also an AI development kit . C-evo by design , is completely deterministic : Its only randomness lies in what the map looks like , where each player starts and what the player ( s ) choose to do . There are no random events , goodie-huts , or random rewards for exploration . C-evo by design , says AIs play by the same rules as humans and therefore AIs can not cheat or bend the rules to favor themselves . However , one may set any of the 15 players to an easier or harder level at the start of the game and may edit the map to set AI and human starting positions . C-evo by design , says military unit designs must be created by a player and then researched before that unit can be built . One must strategically choose what qualities ( for example : mobility , attack power , defense , etc. ) will be built into the units before designing and building them . In contrast to Civilization II , a player can not immediately gain the advances acquired from other nations or the Great Library : a reduced amount of research is still necessary to achieve the new technology . In contrast to Civilization II , a player does not acquire knowledge from capturing a city unless that player possesses the Temple of Zeus Wonder and it is still active ( or obsolete but restored with the Eiffel Tower Wonder ) . In contrast to Civilization II , irrigation does not require the connection to a nearby sea or river , irrigation may be built on any qualifying tile anywhere . In contrast to Civilization II , a diagonal step requires 1.5 movement points . All units have at least 1.5 points possible , the most primitive ships have 2.5 , and the most primitive aircraft have 4.5 . In C-evo , a new city does not gain trade resources or contribute to research until it has at least a town hall or courthouse built . In C-evo , a stealth aircraft is hidden and can not be attacked unless your own spy or stealth aircraft has uncovered it in that turn , in which case your other planes can attack it . In C-evo , building a spaceship requires scarce modern resources , and without access to the territories containing these resources , as well as the advancements to see or use these resources , the game can not be won . C-evo HowTo - A How To guide for playing C-evo geared for someone who has never played any of the Civilization games before ( recommended reading even for those who have , because C-evo is NOT exactly like Civ2 ) . C-evo wiki forum - An alternative to the official C-evo forum , primarily for discussing content of this wiki , but open to all questions and ideas and more easily searchable than the official forum .",1,1
"Held at the Palais des Nations , Geneva , on Wednesday , 2 September 2009 , at 10.10 a . m . President : Mr. Christian STROHAL ( Austria ) The PRESIDENT : I declare open the 1157th plenary meeting of the Conference on Disarmament . It is a particular honour and pleasure for me to be able to welcome the Federal Minister for European and International Affairs of the Republic of Austria , Mr. Michael Spindelegger , to this Conference . Mr. Spindelegger has had a long career , in spite of his young age , in the Austrian Parliament and the European Parliament . He has been the Second President of the Austrian Parliament and the foreign policy spokesperson of the People's Party , and became a minister last year . We are delighted that he has made it to Geneva , where he has arrived at a busy time when we are preparing not only for the closure of this year's session of the Conference on Disarmament but also for the General Assembly of the United Nations , as well as for the relevant activities of the Security Council , on which Austria will be represented next year as a non-permanent member . I now give the floor to the minister . Mr. SPINDELEGGER ( Austria ) : Mr. President , Thank you for this opportunity to address the Conference on Disarmament today . Austria has assumed the presidency of the Conference at an important point in time . This year the Conference finally adopted a programme of work after more than a decade of stalemate . This is a positive , long overdue development . So I do not need to speak about deadlocks or the missed opportunities of the past . Let me focus on recent positive developments in arms control and disarmament and their implications for our future . The year 2009 has seen one paramount development : the goal of nuclear disarmament and the eventual total elimination of nuclear weapons has been put back on the global agenda . I welcome the five-point plan for disarmament proposed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr. Ban Ki-moon , which I had the opportunity to discuss with him a few days ago in Austria . I also welcome the recent positive statements that have been made by United States President Obama in Prague and Cairo and by Russian President Medvedev . And only a few weeks ago , Chinese Foreign Minister Yang underlined China's goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world here in this very room . Austria promoted the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons throughout the cold war , when only a few countries possessed nuclear capabilities . Since proliferation has introduced new threats from States and non-State actors , striving for this goal is now all the more necessary . Our vision is now shared by the most important nuclear powers . But how far has this vision been translated into concrete action ? We can identify two developments . First , direct bilateral negotiations : we see a renewed readiness to engage in bilateral negotiations . The commitment by President Obama and President Medvedev to negotiate a new strategic arms reduction treaty by the end of this year is a good example . Second , the global atmosphere in multilateral arms control negotiations has changed : preparations for the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) show a markedly better atmosphere . Initiatives by States and civil society all around the world , such as the Security Council summit on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament due to be held on 24 September , ensure global ownership and demonstrate a new readiness to engage in dialogue . But let me be clear : positive declarations , a good atmosphere and universal interest also need real implementation and compliance . The NPT can only fulfil its promise of peace if all States adhere to their obligations . Similarly the programme of work of the Conference on Disarmament needs to be implemented if it is to become a real achievement . This brings me to my next point - our expectations for the future . First let me start with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) , a treaty which originated in this chamber . The deplorable nuclear test conducted by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in May has made clear that the entry into force of the CTBT is overdue . As Co-Chair , together with Costa Rica , Austria has been deeply involved in efforts to secure this goal over the past two years . Let me thus use this opportunity to appeal once again to those States that have not yet done so to accede to the CTBT as soon as possible . I am encouraged by the recent commitment of President Obama to pursue ratification by the United States , and also by China's comments in this regard . Let me appeal to all States to show their support for the treaty at the Article XIV conference in New York later this month , and to all delegation 's present to help ensure that their country participates . Second , Austria believes that a comprehensive fissile material cut-off treaty ( FMCT ) - a treaty that still has to emerge from this chamber - would significantly contribute to nuclear disarmament . Reliable techniques for monitoring and verification have been developed over the past years . The potential positive impact of such a treaty has been confirmed many times . The IAEA is ready to make an important contribution . It now requires the political will of Governments and the efforts of skilled negotiators to make it a reality . It is my sincere hope that the new spirit in the Conference on Disarmament will soon enable it to proceed with actual work and start negotiations on an FMCT . Finally , when we talk about expectations for the upcoming year , we must mention the NPT Review Conference , which will take place next May in New York . The Preparatory Committee has shown a willingness to achieve a meaningful outcome this time . Today , we see a broad understanding that the dangers of nuclear technology need to be contained in a manner that creates trust and confidence among all States . The Review Conference will demonstrate whether we are capable of transforming this positive atmosphere into real progress . Austria will present and support initiatives aimed at making substantial progress in nuclear disarmament , non-proliferation and a global system to effectively control the nuclear fuel cycle . This should help to avoid tensions such as the ones we are currently witnessing in regard to the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of Iran . Austria attaches great importance to arms control also in the area of conventional weapons such as landmines , cluster munitions and small arms and light weapons . Let me make three brief comments in this respect . First , with regard to landmines : Austria's objective for the Second Review Conference of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention , to be held later this year in Cartagena , Columbia , is to work for a strong Cartagena action plan , which will serve as a clear guide to States and bring us closer to a world free of mines . One priority for us is to improve assistance to landmine survivors . In this respect Austria has sponsored - together with Norway and civil society partners - a project to examine the global impact of the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention and what remains to be done to improve the situation of survivors . The report will be presented here today right after this meeting . Let me just use this opportunity to encourage all States that have not yet done so to accede to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention . It is time for the international community not only to review its stance on nuclear weapons but also to finally eradicate this terrible weapon . Second , with regard to cluster munitions : I encourage States to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions . So far 17 States have ratified it . It is our strong hope that the Convention will receive the necessary 30 ratifications to enter into force before the end of this year . To support this , Austria has engaged in a worldwide campaign and will support a conference on cluster munitions in Indonesia in November . Third , with regard to small arms and light weapons : these are a major security threat in parts of the world . Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan once called them the "" real weapons of mass destruction "" . Every year , hundreds of thousands of people are killed by them . The United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent , Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects is a significant step forward . Austria supports its implementation on the ground , especially in Africa . To stop the illicit arms trade , Austria supports the conclusion of a legally-binding international arms trade treaty . As a producing and exporting country of small arms , Austria feels a special responsibility to engage in this process and will also host the concluding conference of the global joint project of the European Union and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in February 2010 . We hope that the conference in Vienna will provide positive momentum and enable the conclusion of a treaty in the near future . One thing is clear : there is no lack of work in the field of arms control and disarmament today and the international community is responding positively . In order to succeed , I count not only on the new flexibility of the nuclear-weapon States and the constructive contributions of all the other States , but also on the commitment and expertise of civil society . Throughout the years , non-governmental organizations and private citizens have remained important motors of the disarmament and arms control process . Austria has always underlined that disarmament and arms control must be an open , participatory process if it is to succeed . Protecting the world from the harm caused by weapons is a global project and needs active support from all of us . In this respect , I would like to thank the Secretary-General of the Conference for his tireless efforts , and this year's other presidencies - Viet Nam , Zimbabwe , Algeria , Argentina and Australia - for their excellent cooperation in the Conference on Disarmament . I wish the Conference the necessary energy for a good conclusion to this year's session and an early and effective resumption next year . The PRESIDENT : I thank the minister for his statement . Before adjourning this plenary meeting , let me just make two brief announcements . The first is , as mentioned , at 11 a . m . in this chamber , the minister will launch the report "" Voices from the Ground "" , a report in which victims of landmines and explosive remnants of war will speak out on victim assistance . The next plenary meeting of the Conference will be held tomorrow at 11 a . m . in this chamber . At that time , the Chairman-Designate of the First Committee of the General Assembly , Ambassador José Luis Cancela of Uruguay , will deliver a statement . This plenary meeting is adjourned .

"Tips for Storing Cookies How to Store and Keep your Cookies Fresh You have spent the afternoon baking and your kitchen is overflowing. But unless you intend eating them all at once, (a tempting thought I'll admit) you will need to store your baked goodies to keep them as fresh as possible. Fortunately most cookies are easily stored. The key to storing cookies is to choose an airtight container. This could be either a jar or tin with a tight-fitting lid, or a sturdy plastic container with an airtight lid. Of course different types need to be stored differently. Delicate ones, such as decorated sugar cookies will need to be treated more carefully than say chocolate chip. If stored correctly most cookies will retain their taste and texture for up to a week. Tips for Storing Cookies Always allow to cool completely before storing. They can be stored in glass or ceramic jars, cookie tins or plastic containers, any container really as long as it has a tight fitting lid. If you are unsure about the fit of the lid, put the cookies in a sealed plastic bag first. Separate the soft ones from the crisp ones to prevent them becoming soggy. Store different flavored and strong flavored cookies separately. Unfilled cookies will keep up to a week if stored in an airtight container. Filled cookies, however, should be eaten as soon as possible to avoid becoming soggy. If fillings contain any dairy products they will need to be refrigerated and eaten as soon as possible. Bars and brownies can be stored in the baking pan. Simply cover with foil or plastic wrap. Decorated Cookies Iced and decorated cookies can be successfully stored but remember to allow the icing to harden and set first. Otherwise you will destroy your beautiful handiwork. Fragile ones should be stored in a shallow tin. Separate each layer with a sheet of waxed paper and don't have more than 3 layers. Too much weight may crack the bottom layer. Soft Cookies Soft cookies should be stored in an airtight container. Trapping the moisture inside will keep them soft and chewy. To freshen soft cookies that have become hard, add a piece of apple or a slice of brown bread to the container. Replace the bread daily. If the lid of the container doesn't seal properly, place them into a plastic bag first. Separate the layers with waxed paper to prevent them sticking together. Crisp Cookies Crisp cookies can be stored in a container with a loose fitting lid. This will allow any moisture that may have accumulated to escape, thus keeping them nice and crisp. However if you live in an area of high humidity, use a tight fitting lid to keep the moisture out. ",2,2

"The Slippery Rock Sliders were formed for the 2007 season to ensure an even number of teams with the Frontier League's addition of the Southern Illinois Miners . The Sliders played 32 home games at Jack Critchfield Park in Slippery Rock , Pennsylvania , with the remaining 64 played on the road . For the 2008 season , the Sliders became a traveling team , playing all of their games on the road under the geographical moniker , Midwest . The Sliders ' 2009 season began on May 29 , at Eastern Michigan University ' s Oestrike Stadium located in Ypsilanti , Michigan . The Sliders played strong - a 33-33 record after 66 games . However , countless injuries and the sale of top starting pitching led to a late-season slump . Pitcher James Albury was sold to the Chicago White Sox and pitcher Caleb Graham was sold to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim . The Sliders had 42 scheduled home dates with 54 scheduled road dates . The Oakland County Cruisers were scheduled move into Diamond at The Summit on July 16 , 2010 after playing three three-game series ( nine games total ) at Oestrike Stadium during the first half of the 2010 Frontier League season , however , the organization was unable to obtain funding in time for this to occur . The Cruisers played 78 of its 96 regular-season games on the road . The Cruisers led the Frontier League East for better than two months . However , the high amount of road games ( 30 more than any other team ) and the solid play of the Windy City Thunderbolts and Traverse City Beach Bums down the stretch led to a third-place finish - only four games out . Interim Manager Gera Alvarez won 2010 Frontier League Manager of the Year . Pitcher P.J. Zocchi and first baseman Joash Brodin were named to the Frontier League End-of-Year All-Star Team . Zocchi tied the Frontier League record for saves in a season with 26 ( matched Matt Petty of the Windy City Thunderbolts in 2007 ) and was named Frontier League Relief Pitcher of the Year . Construction on Diamond at The Summit was supposed to begin in October 2010 with the stadium completed in June 2011 . The complex would hold approximately 4,000 fans and function as a year-sound sports and entertainment complex in Waterford Township . After a groundbreaking ceremony with officials of Waterford Township , the area still sits as a vacant parking lot to the adjoining and vacant Summit Place Mall . A small sign touting the construction project sits on the corner of two shopping mall "" streets "" with fading color in a sea of weeds . The Sliders were Ypsilanti's first pro baseball team in nearly a century , since they were awarded a franchise in the Class D Border League in 1913 . The Border League was sometimes called a "" trolley league "" because its six franchises ( in southeastern Michigan and Ontario , Canada ) were located on the interurban lines ; they played a limited schedule of games , primarily on weekends . Managed by former major-leaguer Ducky Pearce , the unnamed Ypsilanti team took the pennant with a 24-10 record , then folded with the rest of the league . Ypsilanti thus held the distinction of being one of the few cities to win a championship in its only season hosting a pro ballclub . College baseball remains popular in Ypsilanti : Eastern Michigan University won a NAIA national championship in 1971 and made it all the way to the championship game of the NCAA College World Series in 1976 before losing to Arizona . The Hurons ( now Eagles ) remain the last northern school to play for the CWS title .",1,4

"Sunday, 11 November 2012 One--Dollar Wonderland! This morning we popped out to Salvo's Williamstown, where I found a (among other things) this cute retro teatowel for $3.99. Then on the spur of the moment we decided to head over to the Laverton Lighthouse. Hadn't been there in a while, and got a bit lost - but it was worth it! All clothes $1! A denim jacket, this interesting skirt, a grey wool Fletcher Jones jacket, and a slightly strange grey rollneck jumper. I also found some pillowcases and an embroidered quilt cover which are perfect for a couple of projects I am working on. Oh and these darling vintage spools, which cost me less than 50c! There is a tiny Missionpoint on Somerville Road which is only open a few days a week. They get a lot of dumping at the front of the shop. Last Tuesday on my way to work I saw a red suitcase had been dumped with some other stuff. I wasn't going to be able to get there until Thursday, so philosphically I thought if it was still there it was meant to be mine! Indeed it was, in fact it was still in front of the shop under a lot of other stuff. It hadn't been priced so I offered them $4. It's pretty battered and one of the catches is broken, but for that price I'm stoked. I have a big crush on retro and vintage luggage at the moment. Last but not least I got to Savers on Friday and got this little beauty for $7.99! This is sewing machine #4 for me! At least it doesn't take up much room :-) By the way, Savers Footscray is having a 50% off Clothing Sale on Monday 12th. I'll have to get out of bed early tomorrow.... 4 comments: Nice work. I have lots of ""vintage"" spools. They were my mum's and I also have one of those ""retro"" suitcases which I have owned since new. I'm beginning to feel old. Have to agree, though, that wooden spools have a good look to them. Great finds. Are you going to show us the pillow cases and embroidered quilt cover as well? I'd KILL to see that!

"That evening the queen said to Keo , who was growing to be a fine child for his age : "" I wish you 'd run across the bend and ask your Uncle Nikki to come here . I have found a strange plant , and want him to tell me if it is good to eat . "" The jolly one laughed heartily as he started upon his errand , for he felt as important as a boy does when he is sent for the first time to the corner grocery to buy a yeast cake . "" Guk-uk-uk-uk ! guk-uk-uk-uk ! "" was the way he laughed ; and if you think a hippopotamus does not laugh this way you have but to listen to one and you will find I am right . He crawled out of the mud where he was wallowing and tramped away through the bushes , and the last his mother heard as she lay half in and half out of the water was his musical "" guk-uk-uk-uk ! "" dying away in the distance . Keo was in such a happy mood that he scarcely noticed where he stepped , so he was much surprised when , in the middle of a laugh , the ground gave way beneath him , and he fell to the bottom of Gouie's deep pit . He was not badly hurt , but had bumped his nose severely as he went down ; so he stopped laughing and began to think how he should get out again . Then he found the walls were higher than his head , and that he was a prisoner . So he laughed a little at his own misfortune , and the laughter soothed him to sleep , so that he snored all through the night until daylight came . When Gouie peered over the edge of the pit next morning he exclaimed : "" Why , ' tis Ippi--the Jolly One ! "" Keo recognized the scent of a black man and tried to raise his head high enough to bite him . Seeing which Gouie spoke in the hippopotamus language , which he had learned from his grandfather , the sorcerer . "" Have peace , little one ; you are my captive . "" "" Yes ; I will have a piece of your leg , if I can reach it , "" retorted Keo ; and then he laughed at his own joke : "" Guk-uk-uk-uk ! "" But Gouie , being a thoughtful black man , went away without further talk , and did not return until the following morning . When he again leaned over the pit Keo was so weak from hunger that he could hardly laugh at all . "" Do you give up ? "" asked Gouie , "" or do you still wish to fight ? "" "" What will happen if I give up ? "" inquired Keo . The black man scratched his woolly head in perplexity . "" It is hard to say , Ippi . You are too young to work , and if I kill you for food I shall lose your tusks , which are not yet grown . Why , O Jolly One , did you fall into my hole ? I wanted to catch your mother or one of your uncles . "" "" Guk-uk-uk-uk ! "" laughed Keo . "" You must let me go , after all , black man ; for I am of no use to you ! "" "" That I will not do , "" declared Gouie ; "" unless , "" he added , as an afterthought , "" you will make a bargain with me . "" "" Let me hear about the bargain , black one , for I am hungry , "" said Keo . "" I will let your go if you swear by the tusks of your grandfather that you will return to me in a year and a day and become my prisoner again . "" The youthful hippopotamus paused to think , for he knew it was a solemn thing to swear by the tusks of his grandfather ; but he was exceedingly hungry , and a year and a day seemed a long time off ; so he said , with another careless laugh : "" Very well ; if you will now let me go I swear by the tusks of my grandfather to return to you in a year and a day and become your prisoner . "" Gouie was much pleased , for he knew that in a year and a day Keo would be almost full grown . So he began digging away one end of the pit and filling it up with the earth until he had made an incline which would allow the hippopotamus to climb out . Keo was so pleased when he found himself upon the surface of the earth again that he indulged in a merry fit of laughter , after which he said : "" Good-by , Gouie ; in a year and a day you will see me again . "" Then he waddled away toward the river to see his mother and get his breakfast , and Gouie returned to his village . During the months that followed , as the black man lay in his hut or hunted in the forest , he heard at times the faraway "" Guk-uk-uk-uk ! "" of the laughing hippopotamus .",8,8

"voter model coexists on the graph with two clusters One can imagine that there is a "" voter "" at each point on a connected graph , where the connections indicate that there is some form of interaction between a pair of voters ( nodes ) . The opinions of any given voter on some issue changes at random times under the influence of opinions of his neighbours . A voter's opinion at any given time can take one of two values , labelled 0 and 1 . At random times , a random individual is selected and that voter's opinion are changed according to a stochastic rule . Specifically , for one of the chosen voter's neighbors is chosen according to a given set of probabilities and that individual's opinion is transferred to the chosen voter . An alternative interpretation is in terms of spatial conflict . Suppose two nations control the areas ( sets of nodes ) labelled 0 or 1 . A flip from 0 to 1 at a given location indicates an invasion of that site by the other nation . Note that only one flip happens each time . Problems involving the voter model will often be recast in terms of the dual system of coalescing Markov chains . Frequently , these problems will then be reduced to others involving independent Markov chains . What we are interested in is the limiting behavior of the models . Since the flip rates of a site depends its neighbours , it is obvious that when all sites take the same value , the whole system stops changing forever . Therefore , a voter model has two trivial extremal stationary distributions , the point-masses δ 0 and δ 1 on η ≡ 0 or η ≡ 1 respectively , which represent consensus . The main question we will discuss is whether or not there are others , which would then represent coexistence of different opinions in equilibrium . We say that coexistence occurs if there is a stationary distribution that concentrates on configurations with infinitely many 0 's and 1 's .",1,1

In this extract they discuss the dilemma of risk management and risk reporting. They argue that there are difficulties in disclosing risk on the grounds that it causes problems with competitors and investors alike. There is also a lack of consensus of how market risk should be measured. They assess how to quantify operational risk and conclude that the gap between improving risk management techniques and risk disclosures needs to be closed. ",1,5

Subscribe to our mailing list Rest assured that your personal details will be kept strictly private and never sold or passed onto a third party. You are probably making it much harder to get a new job than you realise. Just consider that right now: 1. There are fewer advertised job vacancies around. 2. More people are chasing the same advertised jobs . 3. There will probably always be someone more experienced than you applying for the same jobs as you. Whilst there are major cutbacks and a general lack of growth, it actually appears worse because the smart employers (usually the ones that are great to work for) are no longer just using the same old recruitment techniques when a job comes up. Companies know there are great people like you out there in the job market and they can often find them without the traditional, expensive recruitment approach. Strangely it is better for them because they can be more sure of who and what they are getting in the process - but you need to know about what they are doing. So, with fewer advertised jobs and greater competition is there something that will make your life easier, to help you get a new job?

"The MOST satellite design originates from trying to fit as large a telescope as possible , all the electronics to interface with the telescope , the satellite bus equipment that allows the storage and transmission of the science data to the ground , the ACS hardware that is required to maintain better than 25 arcsecond pointing accuracy for the telescope , and a power system to provide enough power to the satellite , all into a package that can meet the requirements for launch as a secondary payload on a Delta II launch vehicle ( with Radarsat-2 as the primary payload ) . It probably bears little resemblance to the satellite design that would have resulted had a launch on the Rockot been planned from Day 1 . However , that is the nature of microsatellite design . The telescope is a 15cm diameter aperture Maksutov telescope . A periscope mirror allows the long axis of the telescope to lie perpendicular to the aperture of the telscope and therefore fit into the Delta II secondary payload physical constraints . Attached to the telescope , separate from the satellite bus structure , is a two stage passive cryocooler that is capable of maintaining the focal plane of the telescope at a temperature of -40 ° C. Covering the aperture of the telescope is a door that is designed to actively close to protect the instrument focal plane from direct sunlight . The satellite structure is based on a tray stack design . The structure consists of aluminum trays that house the satellite's electronics , battery , radios , and attitude actuators . These trays are stacked forming the structural backbone of the satellite . To this backbone , the telescope is mounted with its barrel parallel to the axis of the stack . Six aluminum honeycomb panels , acting as substrates for solar cells and carriers for attitude sensors , enclose the tray stack / telescope assembly . An actuated telescope door mounted on the star facing side of the satellite protects the telescope focal plane from direct stares at the Sun should the satellite tumble or lose attitude lock .",1,1

I am active in all sports. You're analysis has been great. Your systems and suggestions like Sports Insight have been amazing. I've been dong this along time......and well I've been a client for a week and it has been everything you said it would be. Thanks Good work, Rich. I'm happy to be benefitting from your knowledge. It's a lot of fun to have a night like this, 5-0 in MLB. Cheers. Sanjay S. Sipping a Mai Tai & Smoking a Stogie Rich Just sipping a Mai Tai and smoking me a big old Arturo Fuentes Opus (that's a $55.00 cigar) after another 5-0 night. Just to let you know John Morrison has a new gig called champ selections that he claims makes him between $60,000 and $90,000 a month and he don't even have a winng record but he is a legend in his own mind. Keep up the good work. Randy H. Long Term Stats You Have Put Together Are The Way To Go HI Rich, Nice going today. I read your methods of betting and see why you bet the way you do. Hunches lose more money for most bettors and here in Vegas I have seen it all. Long terms stats that you have put together is the way to go and I see exactly what you are doing. There will be down times but in the long haul it is all good. Thanks Rich and the very best to you. Joe F. Another Superb Winner Hi Rich Thanks for adding me to your lists. I decided to watch the results for a couple of days - what a mistake - with the first 4 MLB bets all winning!! I placed my first wager last night on the Colorado State game - another superb winner. Thanks once again. Regards. Tony H. Rich You Have Completely Changed My Life Rich, thank you for your prompt response on the choice picks. I could not believe the whitesox won today 5 to 1 over my favorite team the boston redsox.. I did bet the pick, won some money and was completely shocked. All of the advice e-mails on point spread have been most informative. Please keep the winners coming. Before I joined your sports picks I would always win 2 lose 1,, win 4 lose 1, now I almost so far win everytime,,, I even had the Hurricanes tonight.. I am off to Vegas this week I am on fire with your help/picks and might as well enjoy the good life of winning. The line for the whitesox was +115 and it was the only line that covered. Hmmm, makes you wonder how did Rich Allen know this? Who cares, he just knows.. Rich you have completely changed my life just 28 more days of baseball. Thanks. Max C. I Love Starting The Seaon This Way Rich. Let's keep this streak going. I love starting the season this way but my bookie doesn't lol. Have a great week Rich. If I have any other questions I'll hit you up thanks for being so prompt with your responses very well appriciated. Thanks again. Jason B. A 5 For 5 Day Very Well Done! Congratulations are in order. A 5 for 5 day, very well done. I was a little reluctant on the Packers vs Bears game. But you made it buddy. Real good start of the season. Later. Zishan R. You're A Star Rich, What Else Can I Say? You're A Star. Many Thanks. Gemma M. in the UK Best Weekend I've Had In Awhile Rich, Just want to thank you for a great weekend. This is the best weekend I ever had in awhile. I just got laid off - and your great football picks this weekend have helped me some on my bills. Hopefully, it keeps coming until I find my new job again - and hopefully it continues further. Thank You. Please keep them coming Ryan B. I Am Up $5oo And A Real Believer Hi Rich. After taking the plunge to try this betting with $50 of my very hard-earned money, I decided to try your trial less than a week ago. Being a skeptic, I passed on your first day of 3 MLB picks, only to find out they were all winners! Then I refused to believe there would be good results with college football on Saturday only to watch your 4 system plays sweep Saturday! Finally convinced, I jumped on all your NFL system plays and went 4-0!! I am now up $500, and a real believer. Keep up the good work. Thanks for the wonderful opportunity!! Kevin W. Great Britain I Am Building My Bankroll Rich, I also want to say thank you. I think that you have a good system and as long as people stick to it you can make money over the long run. I don't bet huge but I am building my bankroll following you and I appreciate it. Justin L. Keep Up The Good Work! Rich, So far THE SYSTEM has been AWESOME! It's greed and little patience that kills the average sports better. Realistically there's going to be a loss somewhere down the road. But, like you said in the long run we'll come out ahead. Keep up the good work! RP G. I Do Exactly What You Say And I'm Winning Big Rich, I am doing exactly what you say and winning big. I am only playing your asterik plays because they are so damn accurate. You da man. Cheers. Roger B. in New Zealand I Am Guaranteed To End The Season On The Plus Side Hey! Just wanted to say thank you so much. I started with $50 three weeks ago, and tonight I reached $1,505.00. Your system has been a real find! I am an avid football fan, so I see the occassional can't-miss game(like the Packers last week), but they are few and far between. Your system allows me to methodically work 5 or more games a week...with a very high success rate. I am guaranteed to end the season on the plus side. Thanks INDEED! Kevin W. You Are ""The Truth"" I just wanted to tell you Rich Thanks for providing a great service, you helped me make a lot of money already ... I have never had so much success in sports betting until I tried your system .. I wish I knew about you sooner ... You are "" The Truth ."" Excellent picks and I love how you send the picks the night before. That's a big help because I work in the mornings and cant get to a computer to make the picks or get my email . Finis W. The First Time I Bet I Won $1,870.00 You know what Mr Rich, I'm proudly telling you that I don't regret paying to join your service. The first time I bet I won $1,870.00. That's pretty good for the first timer huh? Before this, I was giving up on this stuff. Today my plan was if I lost this last bet I'll quit for good. I told myself I'll give this system a chance taking advise from your system and pick Vikings. OHHHHH my god. My heart was beating so hard when G.P. scored the point at 2:00 minutes remaining. So far this time I bet total of $300 on Vikings only and if I win I'll continue with the amount of money I won. If I lost all of the money I won well that mean goodbye betting.. I won $600 tonight. Believe me I'm soooooooooooooo happy that I hugged one lady watching the game with me and the deal was I didn't even know that person. That's something new about me. I don't ever hug anyone, not even the ones I know. Thank You! John T. I'm Glad I Made The Purchase Rich, Your system is great, really. I'm glad I made the purchase, doing really well since. Thank you again. Derwin P. For Once I've Paid For Something of REAL Value Rich, I just want to thank you for this lifetime service. For once it seems that I have paid for something of real value. I really appreciate your winning picks and all the extra information. Thank you for this service and the fact that you are really honest about your work and your offering. Believe me, I can use all the help I can get. Thanks again. Rich, First off, i just wanted to tell you that this is incredible what you are doing. Thanks and keep it up. A+++++++++ Russ H. You Da Man Nice picks today Rich! You da man. Keep up the good work. Brian P. Best Picks Ever These are the best picks that I have ever gotten !!! Van C. I Am Forever Grateful Rich, I am writing to you today to let you know that when I read your website about winning 90% of your plays I really thought now this guy really exaggerates his win percentage. When you gave me the opportunity to try the program for $5.00 for the first month I said well for $5.00 I have nothing to lose. Well, now it has been about 2 months and your winning percentage is only 100% when using your system the way it is set up. Since that time I have now purchased your system and have your picks for life, I guess either yours or mine. I am going to follow this system for as long as I have it. It is a true winner. Also, you have been a big help as far as being an honest businessman. When I transferred my membership from monthly to a one time payment, you made sure that the monthly billing stopped for me. I am forever grateful for the work you have done and hope that this system stays true for many years to come. Everybody should be buying your system. Although I hope you limit it so it doesn't change the way it works. Good luck and thanks again. Joe K. Chicago, IL Glad I Found You I don't even remember how I found you but glad I did, can't wait for basketball, thanks Rich. Kris S. I'd Pay More You are really the best Rich.....I really appreciate all of your picks.....I am willing to pay extra if you can give me more action! Richard L. A Big Thank You Rich, I bought the SBP system and all I can say is DAMN! In the 3 days I've owned it, I'm 8-0! Thank you, thank you, thank you! Rob K. I Can't Believe How Well The System Works Well done, nice one - I had my house on it :) - that's how it felt. Keep it going - I still can't believe how well the system works. My A bet is only $20 - but for me that's alot and the winnings are well spent on kids and family. Thank you Lukasz from Poland I Know I Can Count On You From the day I purchased your Platinum Package, I know I can count on you. You're really an oasis in the ocean of dry desert. Anton B. The Best Service I Have Ever Been Associated With Rich I think you have the best service that I have ever been associated with. Thanks Hey Rich, Thought I'd give you a little fanmail...My name is Luis and I'm 24 years old currently residing in Cali. About two months ago I came across a sportsbook that I liked and for the very first time I placed a bet on a baseball team. Come to find out, the interest I had on that game was off the charts even though I only had ten dollars on the game. Ever since then I've just been placing bets for fun. When I came across your program, I actually liked it. I just don't plan on getting rich off of this or anything, but it's just something for me to do. You pick the teams and I place small bets on the games just to have fun with it. After my 30 day trial, I am going to support your program by purchasing a lifetime worth of picks and the sportsbettingprofessor guide. I'm not one that really understands anything about point spreads and the meaning of buying points, nor do I really care, but I just want to have fun with this like I said earlier. I don't know if you get a lot of fanmail or not but I thought I'd just toss this in here. I know a lot of people talk about scam this and scam that but those are simply the ones that get mad when they don't make a million dollars in five minutes. Anyway, can't wait to finish out the rest of the season and start on some new ones. If you have any input I'd be glad to hear what you have to say...Take care Hi Rich, I've been reading your PDF's and they're by far the most professional and thorough sports betting info I've read. Sean C. Love The Service And Thanks For The Special Offer Love the service and thanks for the special offer that made it affordable to me. Regards Dee D. My Bankrolls Have Increased To The Point Where Our Trip Is Paid For Hi Rich, Just want to send some thanks as the wife and I sit in the airport getting ready to fly to Vegas. After starting very conservative with your football systems this last fall my bankrolls have increased to the point where our trip is paid for and the future looks very bright. Cheers! Jim N. Sports Betting Professor .. Is A Cut Above The Rest I have tried various sports betting opportunities in the past and to be quite frank the majority of them aren't worth the paper they're printed on. Sports Betting Professor however is one of very few unique services and is more than a cut above the rest. For me personally, it has proven its worth since I have subscribed to your service. Keep up the great work Rich! Tony M. Thanks.....Keep the Winners Coming!!! Thanks.....keep the winners coming!!! J. Barret Your Systems are The Best Out There your systems are the best out there Thanks Angelo Angelo N. I Thougt for 5 Bucks I need to Try This Guy Out and Damn am I So Glad I Did! Hi rich First I want to say that after 20 yrs of being ripped off by hacks and looking for an honest and reliably consistent service I had all but gave up. Then I found ur website and thougt for 5 bucks I need to try this guy out and damn am I so glad I did! What an unbelievable service you provide! Thank you! Ed It's Easy to Understand Why You Would Be So Highly Recommended Hi Rich, It's easy to understand why you would be so highly recommended by the reviewers. You have a winning system, you are dependable and you maintain lines of communication with your members. Hi Rich, Thanks for your encouragement and it's great to see someone who not only believes, but also sticks by their system. Good luck with your personal bets and enjoy the rest of the MLB season. Kind Regards, Frank Frank S. I Have Total Faith Thanks so much for your reply Rich I very much appreciate it. Makes a lot of sense what you said. I really hear you and have total faith in where you're coming from. I'm bang into these money line bets, there's so much more profit involved and if you lose a few, it doesn't completely nuke all your other wins for the day. Keep up the great work. Thanks again. James Congratulations on an unbelievable sports betting season. I've followed your every picks in NBA, NFL and College football for this whole season and what can I say....Un f@#k believable..:D Nhat N. I Just Wanted To Thank You I just wanted to thank you for a fantastic NFL, NCAA and NBA season. I have never won so many bets before. I only did the system bets - all I can say is: amazing results. I don't bet a lot max $20 bet A but it has been unbelievable. I started with $200 and I have never had to pay in again and every month since September 2009 I have cashed in $300. I also enjoy the statistics you send from time to time - how many system bets we won. This is very useful as I loose count after the first 10 or so wins. So thanks again Lukasz M. Its Great To Deal With Someone Real It is great to deal with someone real for a change ! Jackie R. I Had Great Success With Your NBA System Had great success with your NBA system (THANK YOU) and would be an idiot not to give your MLB system a go. Thanks John A 100% Winning Rate Just thought I would drop a quick line.... I bought your NBA package/system and tips 1 month ago today. I have today made the $1,000 (australian) profit mark. Your ABC system has so far been spot on. I have recorded 6 - A losses, 3 - B losses and 0 - C losses, a %100 winning rate. I will start to increase my bets a bit I think. Thanks again Gavin M.

Your NBA Picks are Amazing Hi Mr. Allen, your NBA picks are amazing. Thank you for the good stuff for last couple weeks:) I can't wait to see the MLB pick. Benny Benny O. I Know I am Getting An Honest Bet Need to relate to you that I had never bet anything in my life until last fall. I was interested from a guy I heard one Sunday morning on the radio. He took me and fleeced me for a lot of money. When his picks were flailing and paying him big bucks I looked around for other services. I tried Accuscore and one other guy (who I will not name) who does it sort of like you BUT he will not put the spread down he gets (which gives a sub a loss and him and his system a 'win') and he has done some other dishonest stuff (imo). You are the only one who has honestly made me money. I bet nothing else now nor do I care to. I know that with you I am getting an honest bet. Thank you! When do we start the MLB? Thanks! Tom H. Great Stuff! Rich, Great stuff, thanks for that. Matt M. Thanks For The Winners! Rich, Thanks for the winners! D. Ralstin I Just Wanted to Say How Happy I Am With Your System.

You are doing it for real!!! Jordan T. I Have Never Seen These Types Of Results Rich, I don't typically like to do this, because right when you start singing praises.........things go the other way. However, I have been a professional gambler since the 80s. Typically, I don't move much in the NBA. I have never seen these types of results in the NBA. Ever. And well, I jumped in at the right time. Great job. TO Todd O. Thanks For All Of Your Hard Work Ok cool, thanks for all your hard work in the NBA. You're the man. Paul H.

Yours Is By Far The Best! Dear Rich, I am a 68 year old retiree and have been betting the ponies and sports for many years. My sports betting was usually confined to games I played in but at 68 those days are over(except for golf). Usually my sports bets were losers in the long run. I never had a winning season or a winning year prior to joining your service. I follow your betting plan (A-B-C) to the letter and only bet the games with the * symbol. I am now showing major profits for the very first time. I have been through quite a few other sports betting services and I'm here to tell you that yours is by far the best. Michael Y. Great System, Wonderful Profits! Hey Rich, great system wonderful profits Jared K. Boy You Are A-W-E-S-O-M-E !!! Hi Rich! Boy you are A-W-E-S-O-M-E !!!

I am not a well off person so took a HUGE gamble when taking up your services! After only 4 days I can see you REALLY are the REAL DEAL! Lost a lot of money with quite a few other tipsters, etc. in the past! THANKS AGAIN!!! Regards. Jaspal Jaspal S.

Regards Tony from Sweden, Scandinavia Tony - Sweeden You Have A Special Gift! keep up the great work, the gambling GODS WIll always ride with us. YOu have a special gift and as always GOD BLess you we will prosper! Dat N. Your System Is Incredible!! Thanks Rich! Rachael and I are strict system players, your system is incredible!!!! My name is Rich Allen and for my entire adult life I have been betting on sports and Losing. I would bet my with my gut, which usually meant betting on my favorite team. I would win a few, but just as fast, I would lose it right back. You know the feeling. Year after year, I would lose money like crazy and I would spend the rest of the year living like a peasant making up for my gambling losses. It was hell!!! Then It Happened! 5 Years Ago I met a Russian PhD who taught statistics at a local university. He told me he could predict winners at least 90% of the time. This guy had never even watched an NFL game. So the next week we meet for coffee. He hands me a sheet of paper with a list of 9 teams. These teams, he told me, would be the winning bets on the weekend. Then he handed me another sheet of 5 teams. This list was the teams to avoid betting on no matter what. I hate to admit it but 5 of the teams I planned to bet on were on the ""Do Not Bet"" list of my Russian PhD friend. I thought, ""This guy has no clue,"" and my ego wasn't going to let some egghead tell me how to bet. I probably don't have to tell you that 4 of my 5 picks lost that weekend. And 8 of his 9 picks won. He had my attention... They All Laughed When I Said I was Going to Win 90% of My Football Bets. But When The Winnings Started Coming... Almost every program has some missing link which is why I couldn't win consistently. But then it hit like lightning... I paid the professor and a group of his colleagues thousands of dollars (most of my life savings) to analyze every outcome in the NFL for the last 15 years. While the data he came up with was relatively simple, it was amazing. There were some commonalities, and if you had the discipline to stick to what the numbers showed, you would win: Just like the MIT blackjack team, the star stock traders, or the few sports bettors in the world who can make a living doing this.... In fact... some of my friends wanted me to do for them what I had done for myself. And I did just that... I began helping my friends follow my new formula for winning football bets... And guess what? They each had the same kind of phenomenal results that I did. I knew I was onto something very new, very real, and VERY exciting. And now, I'd like to share the same techniques with you, if you're ready... If you read this letter I guarantee you a major turnaround in your sports betting success! '6 - 0' puts a BIG smile on your face! Week after week of piling up the wins, like this 6-0 performance. Heres the proof... Results Since my friend proved so successful at NFL Football, I had him take a look at College football and it worked just as well. Next we tried NBA Basketball, with this kind of success why limit it to just 5 months a year? Well, guess what? We discovered an NBA formula that brought us just as much money as the NFL system! This was like hitting the lottery... TWICE! After further intensive research we cracked the statistical codes for Major League Baseball. Now we never have to take a month off from making ridiculous amounts of money! The winners are NOT the ""Insiders"". Guys like ESPN's Bill Simmons, the most widely read sports columnist on the Internet and probably all of America, has more access to insider opinions than any of us could ever hope to have. He writes a weekly column with his picks that he makes based on this information. One problem: his wife, who admittedly knows nothing about sports, consistently has a better record picking winners. Bill relied on his connections while his wife made choices like picking Seattle because her aunt used to live there. If you want to lose money even faster, listen to the other so-called experts out there. Or even worse: try buying picks from a handicapper (or SCAM-dicapper!) that relies on a dartboard. Now I am not suggesting you ask your mom if she likes visiting Miami more than San Diego and make your decisions that way. No way. What I am saying is that the guys who know all the inside scoops have no clue what a winning bet will be. And I suspect that your buddies who rely on their ""gut"" instincts are getting hosed. You watch all the games and pre-game shows, you play in a Fantasy league, you know your stuff - you would think that your knowledge of the teams, the stats, and the injury reports would put you in a sweet position to clean up. T3 So far THE SYSTEM has been AWESOME! It's greed and little patience that kills the average sports better. Realistically there's going to be a loss somewhere down the road. But, like you said in the long run we'll come out ahead. Keep up the good work. Paul. G. Marin, California Big-cart- T5 I wanted to say that I understood the first time I read how the system works. I also want to say thank you. I think that you have a good system and as long as people stick to it you can make money over the long run. I don't bet huge but I am building my bankroll following you and I appreciate it. Justin L. Lubbock, Texas Big-cart- T7 Just want to thank you for a great weekend. This is the best weekend I ever had in awhile. I just got laid off - and your great football picks this weekend have helped me with some on my bills. Hopefully, it keeps coming until I find my new job again - and hopefully it continues further. Thank You. Please keep them coming. Ryan B. San Diego, California Big-cart- T12 Nice going today. I read your methods of betting and see why you bet the way you do, Hunches lose more money for most bettors and here in Vegas I have seen it all. Long terms stats that you have put together is the way to go and I see exactly what you are doing. There will be down times but in the long haul it is all good. Thanks Rich and the very best to you. Joe F. Las Vegas, NV Big-cart- For the first time I've decided to make my unbeatable statistical sports betting system available to a limited number of individuals. You have the golden occasion today to cash in on the most incredible gambling secrets ever. I hate any hype that's blown up beyond its rational proportions. But, I make no embellishment (and you'll soon understand!) when I say that my monster sports betting system is truly unmatched in its winnings. The truth will surprise you just as much as it surprised me on how successful it has become. I win over 90% of the sports bets I place , and because of that I have stockpiled a mountain of unthinkable fortune over the years! In fact, I've won so much the sportsbooks are trying to ban me from using my formula to make a killing! So now I've decided to unleash my system to the world. But I'm only going to sell it to a limited number of people to make sure we can still get our action in. Once you gain access to the picks, you'll make amounts of money you never thought possible. For so little time spent nothing will ever be this easy-- regardless of your finances, no matter where you are from, regardless of your sports knowledge or experience level! My picks win. Since testing my system, I've made LOTS of money from my on-the-side hobby -- and that sum is growing each day. Whether you love watching games and betting, or if you're just an average Joe looking to make some extra $$, this system is the best one on the market. ""So How Much, Rich?"" The Sports Betting Professor System presents an easy-to-follow, easy-to-stick-to, truly effective approach to winning sports bets and it completely eliminates the complexity of many other popular betting systems that don't really work or that result in very minimal improvements! So for something this powerful, you may be wondering just how much for all of this? My program has been proven over and over again many thousands of times to deliver maximum wins in minimum time -- you can see that for yourself in my testimonials on this page (and they represent only a fraction of the testimonials I receive every day!) If you were to invest in me as your personal betting coach you would pay me $500 per hourly session and half of your winnings. I get results so it would be money well spent. So, let's say that you spent 5 hours with me to get this program down pat to do it on your own going forward. That would be $2,500 -- a small investment for a success rate that will make weekends fun again and your buddies jealous of you. So ... I'm sure I could easily sell a proven system like this for $2,500 or more and it would still be an incredible bargain considering how much you could win in just a few months! (Many handicappers with no statistical system get hundreds of dollars for each game). But I'm not going to charge you $2,500... or $2,000 or even $1,000. My partners want me to charge a total of $147.00 monthly to receive these incredible picks. Well brace yourself, because for a very limited time only, you can lock in your own lifetime of winnings for just... Look at it this way: The money you invest in my program is a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of money you've probably wasted on useless betting websites and magazines. It's probably even less than most of your losses for the past couple of games! And when my program starts billing you in 30 days, you will pay for it with house money. It will pay for itself before you ever give me a dime. For less than the cost of dinner and a few drinks, you can finally have that spectacular winning streak you deserve! PLUS - I am betting on your success! That's right ... I'm so confident that this program will TRULY blast your winnings into the stratosphere that I am even betting my shirt on you with my one of a kind guarantee... My ""No Questions Asked Guarantee"" Guarantee I don't make a nickel from you if you don't profit under my system. If I can't help you become one of the most accurate bettors in the world, then I'm not worthy to make anything off of you. That's the standard I live by. Consider this: If you are to lose money in sports betting when using my systems, I insist that you contact me and I'll never bill you. No ifs. No ands. No buts. No questions asked. No hard feelings! Rich-allen No, this is Real!! - for $47 per month after making me prove myself with a $5 trial, you can kidnap one of the most accurate bettors in the world and make him email his picks before every game that qualifies for his system. These are the picks he has used to win 90% of the strict system bets he's made. The moment you gain access to the picks, you're going to kick yourself because of how much better off you would be at this point had you been using the picks over the last few years! The investment will pay for itself before you are ever billed! Heads up: There's an ongoing spamdexing of Google searchbot algorithms.

"My mate's dad has his 1986 Porsche 944 for sale, and has done for a while. He has owned it from new, has full Porsche service history and is in excellent condition and all original apart from the leather seats which were re-trimmed by Porsche for a considerable sum of money. The car runs great and the only thing it requires is a new petrol tank which is now leaking slightly. Anyway, he now has a new Porsche and this old 944 has sat for ages and he is now desperate to get rid of it. He is literally giving it away yet noone wants it and is now threatening to scrap it! If I had the space I would instantly have it myself but alas I don't. I thought these were becoming quite collectable but judging by the lack of interest seem rather unloved which is a shame as they seem to go quite well for what they are. Anyone else struggled to get rid of a car they thought would be very easy to sell? There's definitely love for them out there. Being an 86 it should have a plastic fuel tank which generally don't leak, are you sure it's not the fuel lines leaking where they go over the rear suspension? The 944's an odd one. Their values have been all over the place. There was a time a few years back when they started climbing in the direction of 10k, but then the '90s sports cars started hitting the second-hand market and suddenly people with that kind of money to spend preferred to buy a Lotus Elise or a Porsche Boxster S instead. Nowadays I'd even say I'm shocked at how cheap they've become. For a fully-galvanised 'proper' Porsche that's not exactly slow, nor is it overly thirsty or completely impractical, I think they're a bargain and I can't work out why they're so cheap either. OK, they're not Elises, but they're not meant to be. I'd rather do the run to Le Mans in a 944 than an Elise. If he is literally giving it away and it still has an MOT, I'll come and get it. Always liked the 944 since my mate bought one (an A reg, if I remember correctly) in white. When a truck side-swiped it, he parked it at mine while waiting for the insurance, and it ended up in the photos of my particulars of sale for the house, luckily with the damage hidden on the house side!

OK, they're not Elises, but they're not meant to be. I'd rather do the run to Le Mans in a 944 than an Elise. I agree, it's a comfy old thing for what it is and feels very solid. The bodywork on it (fully galvanised like you say) is amazing for the age of car. I really wish I had the space because I'm sure some day an original one in good condition will start to appreciate. On a side note, I had a go of it for the first time and the steering and handling is really good, nice and direct and quite chuckable. The only thing was getting used to where the hand brake is! Virtually giving it away? Obviously not or it would be gone. An eBay auction with a 99p start, no reserve and a detailed description and lots of photos will see it gone and at the value the Market sets. Virtually giving it away? Obviously not or it would be gone. An eBay auction with a 99p start, no reserve and a detailed description and lots of photos will see it gone and at the value the Market sets. He said LITERALLY giving it away. Twice. If that's the case, I'll have it. If he is literally giving it away and it still has an MOT, I'll come and get it.

When a truck side-swiped it, he parked it at mine while waiting for the insurance, and it ended up in the photos of my particulars of sale for the house, luckily with the damage hidden on the house side! I'm not sure it still has an MOT as it has been SORNED for a bit, I'm based in Yorkshire and the car is in Dumfries (Scotland). I've just been up visiting them hence my interest in the car's lack of interest! Assuming it's the 400 one: It says ""rust"". This means the sills are shot, almost certainly. It's in Cornwall. It doesn't mention a leaky fuel system. If you haven't charged the battery, how little of a monkeys does that look like to prospective buyers? There is a thread on here almost weekly, and at least fifty percent of them arent started by me List the model, miles and condition and we can tell you how much we think its worth. 944's, to my mind, go like this, Box of bits/project 500 1000 Running Lux with MOT 1500 Nice Lux 2000 Concourse Lux 3000 944 S 2000 - 3000 Ropey S2 1500 - 2500 Decent S2 Coupe 3000 - 4000 Mint S2 Coupe 4000 - 5000 S2 Cab 3000 - 6000 Turbo 3000 - 7000 968 50 968 Cab 50 + Bag of Beef Hula Hoops Then you get the ones in dealers that have ""Carriage Company"" in their name, the ones that get hold of a decent 944 and polish it to death and then decide it is 12 grands worth, accompanied by a load of old flannel in the advert, if for some reason it has 30k or less on it, double the price and the amount of flannel in the advert. Obviously there are modded ones and track cars out there, difficult to value, depends what you think its worth. The Turbo is the one everyone wants, I fancied a 944 for ages and alwways thought I wanted a Turbo coupe, but as I am lazy and a S2 Cab came up I just bought that and I love the whiffy old thing, however the Turbos are the ones that people want but the other models all have their virtues, a Lux on the 14 inch wheels is meant to be the purest 944 but it is also the slowest, some prefer the looks of the earlier model and they now look retro rather than just old, some like seeing Boxster wheels and 968 mirrors on a 944, can look ok but not for me, no point in modernising them now. Assuming it's the 400 one: It says ""rust"". This means the sills are shot, almost certainly. It's in Cornwall. It doesn't mention a leaky fuel system. If you haven't charged the battery, how little of a monkeys does that look like to prospective buyers? 400, that is cheap Cornwall is a problem as it is sparelsey populated and miles from the main cities, if it doesnt go, could cost more to move it than to buy it. Assuming it's the 400 one: It says ""rust"". This means the sills are shot, almost certainly. It's in Cornwall. It doesn't mention a leaky fuel system. If you haven't charged the battery, how little of a monkeys does that look like to prospective buyers? Well it's not that one for a start! I'm going to get more info on the car then get an advert on here for him as it seems like there may be more interest. I'm not sure it still has an MOT as it has been SORNED for a bit, I'm based in Yorkshire and the car is in Dumfries (Scotland). I've just been up visiting them hence my interest in the car's lack of interest! No MOT and it leaks fuel. If I can't drive it home I don't want it. ...and I've bought cars for 50 cash at night in deserted trading estates, so I'm not exactly a picky buyer. I didn't even know what colour it was until the following morning. Also I'd love a 944. I've even been window shopping for one this week (MX5 has to die before I can buy one). ",0,0
"The future of NZ media even more unpredictable The near term future of New Zealand media companies has become more unpredictable in 2012, according to the latest New Zealand Media Ownership Report published by AUT's Centre for Journalism Media and Democracy (JMAD). The ownership of New Zealand media in 2012 became even more tightly concentrated in the hands of private equity firms, financial institutions and media moguls. The profits and share prices of news media companies have plummeted which has made them ideal takeover targets for financiers and private equity firms who are looking for revenue and restructuring deals. Interestingly enough, MediaWorks now has three major private equity owners instead of one,says reports author Merja Myllylahti. Publishers of New Zealand's two major metropolitan dailies, Fairfax Media and APN, have the same major shareholder; investment house Allan Gray and this has led to speculation that the two media companies would merge their print operations, says the report. There is currently huge shareholder pressure for companies to cut costs, rationalise their operations and sell assets. In a few years time, the structure of the New Zealand media market might look completely different. For example, APN has already started sales of New Zealand media assets including its South Island newspapers and the company is looking for a buyer the New Zealand Herald. Fairfax has also started to sell down its core assets including its stake in TradeMe."" JMAD also found that the trans-national ownership of New Zealand media companies has increased, an example being the takeover of ACP Magazines (publisher of Metro and North & South magazines) by German publishing giant Bauer Media Group. The public media space has also shrunk further. The closure of TVNZ 7 and Stratos reduces content, diversity on free-to-air television. Advertiser-driven and pay subscriber television predominates advertising free television unavailable for New Zealand viewers, comments Wayne Hope, the director of JMAD. ",4,4

"Native Netflix Client Coming to Linux 'In The Next 12 Months' As a Brit the whole "" Netflix "" phenomenon has largely passed me by, b ut I do know that Linux support for the on-demand video-streaming service is a long-held 'want' for many readers.? The good news is that a native Linux client is, according to Netflix engineers, in the works. ? The news come via Benjamin Kerensa who, at this years Open Source Convention 2011 (OSCON), spent some time with a couple of?engineers?from Netflix. ""...when I called Netflix out for not having a solution to make Netflix Instant work on all Linux systems they told me that in fact Netflix has some engineers working on a proprietary client for Linux that should be available in the next 12 months."" Ben writes on his blog. ""The engineers from Netflix were hardcore Linux users themselves and advocates of Open Source and shared my frustration that Netflix had not made headway a lot sooner. They indicated that although work is underway it is not a priority project which is why it may take up to 12 months.?For obvious reasons (non-disclosure agreements etc.) I cannot divulge the Netflix employees names but I'm happy they did even tell me of this excellent progress they are making and how internally they are standing up for the Linux community.""?

"Story 2 - Taking a GAP year after being rejected This person decided to remain anonymous but wanted to tell their story to let people know taking a forced gap year can be a ' blessing in disguise ' ... In my previous application , I was n't 100 % certain that I really wanted to study medicine , and I was n't fully prepared . I think this showed in my PS ( personal statement ) . As the year went on , I was able to confirm that medicine is what I really want to do . Last year , I applied to 4 med schools with no backup choices . I was rejected after 2 interviews ( I was put on a waiting list at one ) . Obviously I was disappointed , but it did n't come as a surprise . I started to make plans for the next round , and by May , I was looking for jobs on the NHS website and it took about 4 months to find what I wanted to do - porter at my local hospital . ( This takes time so do n't leave it until the summer holidays ! ) I also started to look for GAP year medical volunteering opportunities abroad . Once I finished school , I started to volunteer at my local old people's home , 2 or 3 times a week , and I also started working for the NHS . My PS was more interesting the second time around , because I had more to write about . This time , I chose 3 different UNIs from my previous application , but I put down 1 UNI that I was rejected from last year , after interview . This was mentioned at my interview this time , and I was able to explain what I had been doing in my GAP year and what I was intending to do for the remainder of my GAP year . I also put down two back-up choices . I ended up with 4 offers after 3 interviews for medicine , and 1 offer for physiology . I withdrew from the last option ( another physiology course ) because they were taking too long to decide . This "" forced gap year "" has been a blessing in disguise for me ( except for the increase in the fees , of course ) . For one , I am now sure about my choice of course . Plus , I really enjoyed working as a porter in the NHS , and the extra cash that I 've saved up will be useful when I start Uni . So all in all , I 'm very pleased with the outcome . My advice would be to make the most of your GAP year by working or volunteering in medical environment , to strengthen your PS , but mainly , to make sure that medicine is what you really want to do . I am sure that you will be a stronger candidate the second time around , so best of luck to everyone !",5,5

"| 11/13/2012 @ 6:04AM | 1,435 views Forget Mobile First, Think Tablet First The shift from traditional computers to mobile devices will definitively be the hottest topic of 2013, and probably the next few years (smartphones and tablets accounts for 70 percent of total devices sold in 2012 ). Not only will it affect users' behaviors and expectations, but it will directly impact your sales. I am aware of not teaching you anything by writing this, but there is still a lot of work to do in order to be ready for this market shift... and a lot of skeptical people to convince. The biggest problem we are facing now is the IT debate regarding native vs. mobile app . And with the rise of alternative devices to Apple's iPhones and iPads, it is getting even more complicated to figure out how to properly reach customers in a mobile context (see Brad Frost's This is the Web ). Lately, there's been a lot of buzz regarding responsive design layouts, which are presented as THE ultimate solution to mobile device fragmentations. We now have a little more REX with responsive design and the fact that the layout is not the problem, the context is: when using a mobile device like smartphones, users are in a mobile context (commuting or waiting in a line). Thus, users' attention level is so low, that it is not realistic to think a shrunken version of your website will match their needs. If content or services are hard to find on a website viewed through a desktop computer, and it is 80% of the time, it will be even harder to find it on a small screen, with a compact navigation system and a lot of distractions. To make a long story short, you need a boarder approach ( Why Launching A Mobile App Is Pointless ). This being said, where can you start this broader approach? Well, it seems the easiest way to comply to alternative devices' constraints is not to target smartphones, but tablets. By targeting tablets instead of smartphones, not only do you provide computer users with a better reading experience, but you lower the adaptation costs. In just a few months, Tablet First has became a major design trend : Information-heavy websites like USA Today , ReadWrite , TheNextWeb and Forbes adopted a lightweight layout to enhance the reading experience for tablet users. Even top e-commerce websites like Amazon , Ebay or Nike now use a lighter layout in order to satisfy booth traditional computers and tablets users. Does this type of layout will fit mobile users' needs? No, definitively no. But adopting a tablet first approach will make it much easier for you to convince your boss to have a broader approach than launching an iPhone app. Once you started to worry about users NOT using a traditional computer, than you are in the good state of mind to rethink the way your content and services have to be restructured in a true mobile context. My final word: Tablet First is not an IT choice, it is a pedagogic process to ease the evolution of mentality and design choices in order to comply to the new post-PC landscape. Post Your Comment Post Your Reply Forbes writers have the ability to call out member comments they find particularly interesting. Called-out comments are highlighted across the Forbes network. You'll be notified if your comment is called out. Comments Personally, I am not convinced by a Tablet First approach. First, Mobile First and Tablet first are very different. Mobile first is about *focus* and *simplification*. If you cannot accomplish what you seek out to do on Mobile, that is because the objectives of your site is not clear enough, having more space is not the solution. Tablet first, as you present it, is about making a website more touch-friendly and more visually appealing. Secondly, having a nicer touch-friendly website that is easier to sell in the organization is great, but if it does not provide tangible benefits, you have failed. I do not feel Tablet first websites really enhance the user experience. For example, I do not read the Next Web as I used to since their redesign and their new design is directly responsible for this. This is also true for the other examples you provide, although ReadWrite is not as bad. I think there are two reasons for this, to make clickable elements bigger, they had to reduce their number. As a result, Forbes, ReadWrite and the NextWeb hid their navigation, reducing discoverability and increasing the number of clicks users have to do to navigate the website. Secondly, the use of fixed elements. They crowd the screen and distract me from what I was trying to do: read the article. At least, in the old layouts, when I read half the article, I had cleared the sidebar elements and could read in peace. By the way, I DO own a tablet, but forcing a tablet optimized solution is not the way to go. I find the articles on a desktop during the day and  Save the for Later  when I read them at home. Now, I don't even bother to look around anymore... Ok, I get your point. But as it is sais in the final sentence: Tablet First is a change management process. If your boss is ready, or your organization has the maturity to jump into mobile first, then do it first! And you do agree on the fact that this are two distinct topics (layout optimization for tablets and focusing on a single task). This generally makes sense. The responsive web design method is certainly the way to go. I think some people often get stuck on the idea of ""smart phone, iPad, desktop"" versions, but the idea needs be broadened a bit as the market diversifies and we prepare for newer technologies. For example, the iPad mini has its own set of constraints that people are just starting to understand.

"Hansel and Grethel Near a great forest there lived a poor woodcutter and his wife , and his two children ; the boy's name was Hansel and the girl's Grethel . They had very little to bite or to sup , and once , when there was great dearth in the land , the man could not even gain the daily bread . As he lay in bed one night thinking of this , and turning and tossing , he sighed heavily , and said to his wife , "" What will become of us ? we can not even feed our children ; there is nothing left for ourselves . "" "" I will tell you what , husband , "" answered the wife ; "" we will take the children early in the morning into the forest , where it is thickest ; we will make them a fire , and we will give each of them a piece of bread , then we will go to our work and leave them alone ; they will never find the way home again , and we shall be quit of them . "" "" No , wife , "" said the man , "" I can not do that ; I can not find in my heart to take my children into the forest and to leave them there alone ; the wild animals would soon come and devour them . "" "" O you fool , "" said she , "" then we will all four starve ; you had better get the coffins ready , "" and she left him no peace until he consented . "" But I really pity the poor children , "" said the man . The two children had not been able to sleep for hunger , and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father . Grethel wept bitterly , and said to Hansel , "" It is all over with us . "" "" Do be quiet , Grethel , "" said Hansel , "" and do not fret ; 1 will manage something . "" And when the parents had gone to sleep he got up , put on his little coat , opened the back door , and slipped out . The moon was shining brightly , and the white flints that lay in front of the house glistened like pieces of silver . Hansel stooped and filled the little pocket of his coat as full as it would hold . Then he went back again , and said to Grethel , "" Be easy , dear little sister , and go to sleep quietly ; God will not forsake us , "" and laid himself down again in his bed . When the day was breaking , and before the sun had risen , the wife came and awakened the two children , saying , "" Get up , you lazy bones ; we are going into the forest to cut wood . "" Then she gave each of them a piece of bread , and said , "" That is for dinner , and you must not eat it before then , for you will get no more . "" Grethel carried the bread under her apron , for Hansel had his pockets full of the flints . Then they set off all together on their way to the forest . When they had gone a little way Hansel stood still and looked back towards the house , and this he did again and again , till his father said to him , "" Hansel , what are you looking at ? take care not to forget your legs . "" "" O father , "" said Hansel , "" lam looking at my little white kitten , who is sitting up on the roof to bid me good-bye . "" "" You young fool , "" said the woman , "" that is not your kitten , but the sunshine on the chimney-pot . "" Of course Hansel had not been looking at his kitten , but had been taking every now and then a flint from his pocket and dropping it on the road . When they reached the middle of the forest the father told the children to collect wood to make a fire to keep them , warm ; and Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood enough for a little mountain j and it was set on fire , and when the flame was burning quite high the wife said , "" Now lie down by the fire and rest yourselves , you children , and we will go and cut wood ; and when we are ready we will come and fetch you . "" So Hansel and Grethel sat by the fire , and at noon they each ate their pieces of bread . They thought their father was in the wood all the time , as they seemed to hear the strokes of the axe : but really it was only a dry branch hanging to a withered tree that the wind moved to and fro . So when they had stayed there a long time their eyelids closed with weariness , and they fell fast asleep . When at last they woke it was night , and Grethel began to cry , and said , "" How shall we ever get out of this wood ? "" But Hansel comforted her , saying , "" Wait a little while longer , until the moon rises , and then we can easily find the way home . "" And when the full moon got up Hansel took his little sister by the hand , and followed the way where the flint stones shone like silver , and showed them the road . They walked on the whole night through , and at the break of day they came to their father's house . They knocked at the door , and when the wife opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Grethel she said , "" You naughty children , why did you sleep so long in the wood ? we thought you were never coming home again ! "" But the father was glad , for it had gone to his heart to leave them both in the woods alone . Not very long after that there was again great scarcity in those parts , and the children heard their mother say at night in bed to their father , "" Everything is finished up ; we have only half a loaf , and after that the tale comes to an end . The children must be off ; we will take them farther into the wood this time , so that they shall not be able to find the way back again ; there is no other way to manage . "" The man felt sad at heart , and he thought , "" It would better to share one's last morsel with one's children . "" But the wife would listen to nothing that he said , but scolded and reproached him . He who says A must say B too , and when a man has given in once he has to do it a second time . But the children were not asleep , and had heard all the talk . When the parents had gone to sleep Hansel got up to go out and get more flint stones , as he did before , but the wife had locked the door , and Hansel could not get out ; but he comforted his little sister , and said , "" Do n't cry , Grethel , and go to sleep quietly , and God will help us . "" Early the next morning the wife came and pulled the children out of bed . She gave them each a little piece of "" bread - less than before ; and on the way to the wood Hansel crumbled the bread in his pocket , and often stopped to throw a crumb on the ground . "" Hansel , what are you stopping behind and staring for ? "" said the father . "" I am looking at my little pigeon sitting on the roof , to say good-bye to me , "" answered Hansel . "" You fool , "" said the wife , "" that is no pigeon , but the morning sun shining on the chimney pots . "" Hansel went on as before , and strewed bread crumbs all along the road . The woman led the children far into the wood , where they had never been before in all their lives . And again there was a large fire made , and the mother said , "" Sit still there , you children , and when you are tired you can go to sleep ; we are going into the forest to cut wood , and in the evening , when we are ready to go home we will come and fetch you . "" So when noon came Grethel shared her bread with Hansel , who had strewed his along the road . Then they went to sleep , and the evening passed , and no one came for the poor children . When they awoke it was dark night , and Hansel comforted his little sister , and said , "" Wait a little , Grethel , until the moon gets up , then we shall be able to see the way home by the crumbs of bread that I have scattered along it . "" So when the moon rose they got up , but they could find no crumbs of bread , for the birds of the woods and of the fields had come and picked them up . Hansel thought they might find the way all the same , but they could not . They went on all that night , and the next day from the morning until the evening , but they could not find the way out of the wood , and they were very hungry , for they had nothing to eat but the few berries they could pick up . And when they were so tired that they could no longer drag themselves along , they lay down under a tree and fell asleep . It was now the third morning since they had left their father's house . They were always trying to get back to it , but instead of that they only found themselves farther in the wood , and if help had not soon come they would have been starved . About noon they saw a pretty snow-white bird sitting on a bough , and singing so sweetly that they stopped to listen . And when he had finished the bird spread his wings and flew before them , and they followed after him until they came to a little house , and the bird perched on the roof , and when they came nearer they saw that the house was built of bread , and roofed with cakes ; and the window was of transparent sugar . "" We will have some of this , "" said Hansel , "" and make a fine meal . I will eat a piece of the roof , Grethel , and you can have some of the window-that will taste sweet . "" So Hansel reached up and broke off a bit of the roof , just to see how it tasted , and Grethel stood by the window and gnawed at it . Then they heard a thin voice call out from inside , "" Nibble , nibble , like a mouse , Who is nibbling at my house ? "" And the children answered , "" Never mind , It is the wind . "" And they went on eating , never disturbing themselves . Hansel , who found that the roof tasted very nice , took down a great piece of it , and Grethel pulled out a large round window-pane , and sat her down and began upon it . Then the door opened , and an aged woman came out , leaning upon a crutch . Hansel and Grethel felt very frightened , and let fall what they had in their hands . The old woman , however , nodded her head , and said , "" Ah , my dear children , how come you here ? you must come indoors and stay with me , you will be no trouble . "" So she took them each by the hand , and led them into her little house . And there they found a good meal laid out , of milk and pancakes , with sugar , apples , and nuts . After that she showed them two little white beds , and Hansel and Grethel laid themselves down on them , and thought they were in heaven . The old woman , although her behaviour was so kind , was a wicked witch , who lay in wait for children , and had built the little house on purpose to entice them . When they were once inside she used to kill them , cook them , and eat them , and then it was a feast day with her . The witch's eyes were red , and she could not see very far , but she had a keen scent , like the beasts , and knew very well when human creatures were near . When she knew that Hansel and Grethel were coming , she gave a spiteful laugh , and said triumphantly , "" I have them , and they shall not escape me ! "" Early in the morning , before the children were awake , she got up to look at them , and as they lay sleeping so peacefully with round rosy cheeks , she said to herself , "" What a fine feast I shall have ! "" Then she grasped Hansel with her withered hand , and led him into a little stable , and shut him up behind a grating ; and call and scream as he might , it was no good . Then she went back to Grethel and shook her , crying , "" Get up , lazy bones ; fetch water , and cook something nice for your brother ; he is outside in the stable , and must be fattened up . And when he is fat enough I will eat him . "" Grethel began to weep bitterly , but it was of no use , she had to do what the wicked witch bade her . And so the best kind of victuals was cooked for poor Hansel , while Grethel got nothing but crab-shells . Each morning the old woman visited the little stable , and cried , "" Hansel , stretch out your finger , that I may tell if you will soon be fat enough . "" Hansel , however , used to hold out a little bone , and the old woman , who had weak eyes , could not see what it was , and supposing it to be Hansel's finger , wondered very much that it was not getting fatter . When four weeks had passed and Hansel seemed to remain so thin , she lost patience and could wait no longer . "" Now then , Grethel , "" cried she to the little girl ; "" be quick and draw water ; be Hansel fat or be he lean , tomorrow I must kill and cook him . "" Oh what a grief for the poor little sister to have to fetch water , and how the tears flowed down over her cheeks ! "" Dear God , pray help us ! "" cried she ; "" if we had been devoured by wild beasts in the wood at least we should have died together . "" "" Spare me your lamentations , "" said the old woman ; "" they are of no avail . "" Early next morning Grethel had to get up , make the fire , and fill the kettle . "" First we will do the baking , "" said the old woman ; "" I nave heated the oven already , and kneaded the dough . "" She pushed poor Grethel towards the oven , out of which the flames were already shining . "" Creep in , "" said the witch , "" and see if it is properly hot , so that the bread may be baked . "" And Grethel once in , she meant to shut the door upon her and let her be baked , and then she would have eaten her . But Grethel perceived her intention , and said , "" I do n't know how to do it : how shall I get in ? "" "" Stupid goose , "" said the old woman , "" the opening is big enough , do you see ? I could get in myself ! "" and she stooped down and put her head in the oven's mouth . Then Grethel gave her a push , so that she went in farther , and she shut the iron door upon her , and put up the bar . Oh how frightfully she howled ! but Grethel ran away , and left the wicked witch to burn miserably . Grethel went straight to Hansel , opened the stable-door , and cried , "" Hansel , we are free ! the old witch is dead ! "" Then out flew Hansel like a bird from its cage as soon as the door is opened . How rejoiced they both were ! how they fell each on the other 's neck ! and danced about , and kissed each other ! And as they had nothing more to fear they went over all the old witch's house , and in every corner there stood chests of pearls and precious stones . "" This is something better than flint stones , "" said Hansel , as he filled his pockets , and Grethel , thinking she also would like to carry something home with her , filled her apron full . i ! Now , away we go , "" said Hansel , "" if we only can get out of the witch's wood . "" When they had journeyed a few hours they came to a great piece of water . "" We can never get across this , "" said Hansel , "" I see no stepping-stones and no bridge . "" "" And there is no boat either , "" said Grethel ; "" but here comes a white duck ; if I ask her she will help us over . "" So she cried , "" Duck , duck , here we stand , Hansel and Grethel , on the land , Stepping-stones and bridge we lack , Carry us over on your nice white back . "" And the duck came accordingly , and Hansel got upon her and told his sister to come too . "" No , "" answered Grethel , "" that would be too hard upon the duck ; we can go separately , one after the other . "" And that was how it was managed , and after that they went on happily , until they came to the wood , and the way grew more and more familiar , till at last they saw in the distance their father's house . Then they ran till they came up to it , rushed in at the door , and fell on their father's neck . The man had not had a quiet hour since he left his children in the wood ; but the wife was dead . And when Grethel opened her apron the pearls and precious stones were scattered all over the room , and Hansel took one handful after another out of his pocket . Then was all care at an end , and they lived in great joy together . My tale is done , there runs a mouse , whosoever catches it , may make himself a big fur cap out of it .",8,8
"News Local Salvation Army's Byron Keen, left, MP Patrick Brown, Barrie Mayor Jeff Lehman and journalist and broadcaster Rex Murphy help launch this year's Salvation Army Kettle Campaign. Murphy brought warmth and humour as he helped the Salvation Army kick off the event as keynote speaker at the Hope in the City breakfast hosted at the Barrie Country Club, Wednesday. The Salvation Army has set their target at $525,000 for this year's campaign to reflect in increasing need. J.T. MCVEIGH PHOTO As plates laden with Eggs Benedict under a creamy Hollandaise sauce were placed under their noses, more than 200 people gave thanks for the meal and promised to open their wallets for the cause. The kickoff breakfast for the Salvation Army Christmas Kettle campaign pulled in the big guns to help the new leader, Maj. Byron Kean, through his first Christmas in Barrie. Keynote speaker Rex Murphy of CBC television and radio show Cross Country Check-Up host, spoke in an eloquent fashion of his fondness for the Salvation Army. ""In an era that every institution, educational, legal, journalistic or political -- you can't name an institution or body of social action -- that retains that sense of purpose of innocence, and high reputation unscathed by either ill affairs, laziness or abandonment of the first principals,"" Murphy intoned in a charming Newfoundland-riddled conversational tone. ""The army is, what the army was and what the army will be, and it remains absolutely synonymous with the notion of good deeds done with the least possible publicity, which is almost biblical in its veracity."" Murphy chatted colloquially as approximately 230 people dined on an early breakfast at the Barrie Country Club, Wednesday morning. Murphy recounted a story about Sept. 11, 2001, when 33 planes landed at Gander International Airport in Newfoundland and many were taken in by the townspeople, which was organized by the Salvation Army of Gambo, 50 kilometres away. As with any good east-coast yarn, there were personalities aplenty and many guffaws by the assembled crowd as Murphy warmed up, but his poignant closing minutes filled the now sated audience with a zeal to help the Salvation Army achieve their lofty goal of $525,000. ""They, the Salvation Army in Gambo, that story went across the world to Australia, New Zealand and beyond. It became the emblematic story of one of the darkest days in the last 70 years, since the end of the Second World War,"" he said. ""When you had 3,000 dead and however many more injured, the United States in a state of high anxiety, when evil was loosened upon world -- when evil and treacherous people were stealing the airplanes -- that there were still some gleam of light. ""There was some clutch of the common man and people in a very, very poor community associated with a body renowned for helping others, gave in pure reflex action, the hospitality, the civility, the solidarity, that even poor people can give to strangers in need and in exile. ""It was a classic moment, it may have been a day shot through almost entirely with rottenness, but there was one substantial, real gleam of light that came from the citizenry a division of people,"" Murphy added. ""People seeing others in distress and automatically out of their simple hearts, gave of what little things (they had) -- and little things count more than so many things -- they are the things that count. ""This tells you about the Salvation Army. The help that was given by a woman from that institution. The Americans are good at remembering, believe me, they are, so about two months later, they asked her what would you like? Would you like to come to Texas in the nice sunshine, or spend a few weeks on a beach somewhere? ""And she said no, and she wasn't putting it on, she's not self-consciously virtuous, that's what I like about her. ""She said what I would like if you can arrange it, she was a nurse, too, could you get me two months down working with the paramedics workers at the devastation site, the 9/11 site they were still clearing up. ""Her reward, the one she selected, was to go work, the same year, down at the site."" She's Salvation Army. She wants to help. Help is her reward. In the case of the Salvation Army, help is a great thing for people to appreciate, it's a great thing for a society that generates it -- it shows the society has a conscience. A woman who had already done her share for the exiles, some of the anxiety and the stress caused by that horrible day, was asked what would she like for her reward, she said I'd like more time to help more people. ""If there is any more philanthropic religious or otherwise organization that has as clear an idea as the Salvation Army has of what help really means, I've yet to hear about it."" Murphy finished to a standing ovation and quickly leapt from the stage, to sign a few copies of his book, Canada and Other Matters of Opinion, that were given away as gifts to several attendees. Maj. Jeff Robertson, with the regional office of the Salvation Army, asked people to donate to the six or so Salvation Army bubbles that were strategically placed around the club, but also said, ""but if you can't, don't worry about it. We've been quietly going through the pockets of your coats in the coatroom as you listened to Rex."" Volunteers are needed to attend the army's cash bubbles at 17 locations around Barrie. ",4,4
"Snapshots from the Life of a Man who must Work for a Living --  1 He particularly cherished the toilet breaks he allowed himself. The lavatory was his private sanctuary in the midst of the frigid, tubelit, bleakly pastel expanses of his office floor. His first break was scheduled at 11, after his breakfast which usually consisted of three slices of bread, some butter, and a cup of coffee. While he ate alone, the constant hubbub in the canteen (with its peals of tired laughter, its stale air of oft-repeated jokes and the squawking sports channels on its lone television set) rendered the canteen a place ill equipped to provide the warm, comfortable, enclosing privacy of the lavatory. He always took great care in wiping off the seat and placing three equally long strips of paper to form a U on the seat before dropping his pants. The warmth inside was cosy. The fresh breath of just-sprayed deodorants (sprayed every 15 minutes by a blue-liveried attendant who was diligently liberal in his zeal to keep things smelling of lemons) was a welcome change from the soulless odorlessness of the office floor. He would gently slip his shoes off and run his tuberous toe over the cool uncarpeted marble. Some days, he would spend upto a half hour tracing snaking lanes of journeying veins from one interlocked slab to another. He never felt at ease urinating along a line of men into, what he considered with a shudder of disgust, an openly inviting ceramic maw. He found no great pleasure in inspecting the arc, the texture, the flow of his urine nor was he so curious about his fellow men as to evaluate them by the way they set their feet, the bent of their upper body, the one/two-handedness of their grip or the hissing fall of their urine. Indeed, he was quite diffident by nature, with a marked tendency to speak at the collar of those who were taller than him and at the ear (whichever seemed closer) of those shorter or of a height with him. There were moments when he could even be termed shy but these were few and usually involved a social gathering of sorts. So it was that he always carried with him a few choice pebbles that he collected each morning from the assorted refuse on the road on his way to work from the bus stop. These, he would wrap in paper and carry with him into the lavatory for times when his intestines were not inclined to void themselves for his benefit. He would perch himself the usual way and softly plop pebbles in  the water at two- or three-minute intervals. He always ensured his phone would stay at his desk for the duration of his breaks. For these were the few choice moments he had that were his own, when the world was a different planet in a different sky, and he, a lone nomad, content in his box floating through a deep dark space of nothing.

"Uncommon Priors In Soviet Russia, blog hits you. Does it strike anyone else here as a bizarre pathology of capitalism that people can suddenly start suffering because other people start *thinking differently* even as the levels of technology, natural resources, and available labor stay the same? Not that this is in any way an original thought, of course, but this is what happens when you watch The Matrix for the ten-squillionth time on a plane.. Makes for a weird way in which relations of production fetter the productive forces, though, alas, I can hear Hayek screaming at me about the impossibility of doing better. ",5,5
"1.1 The Library Association is the professional body that represents some 25,000 librarians and information workers in the United Kingdom . Under the terms of its Royal Charter , The Association has a duty to promote high quality library and information services and to advise government , employers and others on all aspects of library and information provision . 1.2 Therefore we welcome the opportunity to comment on the Department for Culture , Media and Sport review of the British Library 1.3 The Library Association response is formed by expressions from our membership and is based on their views as both library and information professionals and users of British Library services . The overall impression of the membership is that they appreciate the services provided , they believe the services are of a reasonable standard and that the relationship between the British Library and the library and information profession is good . 1.4 Within that context we offer the following comments for your consideration . 2 . Purpose , aims and objectives 2.1 The British Library meets the aims stated in the Department for Culture , Media and Sport background paper supplied with the review questionnaire . However , we are unable to comment fully on the purpose , aims and objectives of the British Library because we are insufficiently aware of them . We are surprised by this lack of awareness within the profession and we would suggest this carries an important message for the British Library . In order to address this apparent problem The Library Association would welcome working with the British Library on a strategy to improve communication throughout the profession . 2.2 The agenda of the British Library should be as broad as that of Government . Therefore the Library should focus on its contribution to lifelong learning , social inclusion , literacy , information skills and employability . Key areas are access , regionalism and partnership . This requires the British Library to work closely with Government departments that carry forward these agendas . 2.3 A further objective for the British Library should be developing formal professional collaboration and partnership . The Library has a role to play in ' joined-up ' library and information provision . By working with other libraries , professional library and information associations , key professional organisations and commercial partners the British Library can provide an important focus for the library and information profession in the UK . 3 . Organisation , efficiency and effectiveness 3.1 Establishing and maintaining links with departments and personnel at the British Library is sometimes confusing and difficult . There are often apparent overlaps in the titles and responsibilities of different departments . Communication on a theme , topic or project will sometimes appear to stem from several departments , with no underlying staff responsibility clearly discernible . This can create an impression of bureaucracy : streamlining departmental responsibilities and clarifying job titles and contact routes would improve the effectiveness of the Library's communications . 3.2 In general it is felt that the British Library's services offer good value for money , although it must be reiterated that members often do not have an understanding of all of the products and services available . 3.3 The Co-operation and Partnership Programme is a welcome development particularly as it encourages innovation and cross-sectoral partnership . However , the themes for which bids are invited do not reflect the themes in Government policy . 3.4 We welcome the Library's new premises in St Pancras . We also welcome an attitudinal change over the past year , with a move towards greater openness and willingness to "" look beyond St Pancras "" . Access to the building has become easier and the building itself has contributed to the regeneration of one of London's most deprived areas . 3.5 However , there is a developing concern about space within the Euston Road building . One anxiety is the availability of reader seats , particularly in the Humanities Reading Room , as the number of members increase . Another concern is the way in which the role of the British Library as a comprehensive archive is slowly being eroded as a result of the lack of space . This highlights a dilemma for the British Library , that is , the tension between widening access to the collections and maintaining the role of preservation . 4 . Customer relations and responsiveness 4.1 Most Library Association members have experience of BLDSC services and their overall impression of these services is favourable . The inter-library loan service is regarded as effective and efficient and , since going on-line , the speed of service has vastly improved . However , one drawback is cost , which many regard as too expensive . In fact it has been pointed out that the most effective communication from the British Library seem to relate to changes in pricing structures . 4.2 As far as customer relations and the quality framework is concerned there seems to be a lack of a coherent mechanism for taking the views of service users , and non-users , into account . Formal evaluation of the services provided should be transparent and the British Library should benchmark its activities against Charter Mark headings . 4.3 The main market for British Library services seems to be the post-18 education and research community . The Library should be looking for ways of engaging a much wider audience . Key areas for consideration are family learning , information skills training , literacy , IT literacy and adult basic skills . 4.4 The collection policy of the British library should also reflect the complex multicultural UK population . Many perceive the British Library as an institution of cultural and heritage significance . Providing access to materials in the mother tongue or concerning the mother country of many UK citizens may be regarded as important for the British Library in fulfilling its cultural role . 5 . Links with other organisations 5.1 The directional role of the British Library within the UK library profession can not be overemphasised . However , there is a need for the Library to redefine its image to a wider audience placing itself at the heart of a national library network , enhancing the image of libraries in general . 5.2 In order to fulfil its role within the context of Government policy the British Library must develop partnerships with a variety of organisations : libraries in all sectors ; museums and archives ; government departments and bodies ; professional associations , commercial companies and the voluntary sector . There is considerable scope for developing creative partnerships , for example , becoming involved with the Children's Laureate initiative or World Book Day . 5.3 The withdrawal of the British Library cataloguing and conservation grants programme some years ago is still regretted , particularly as the BL Co-operation and Partnership Programme specifically excludes funding for retrospective conversion . It is hoped that the Full Disclosure initiative will address this omission , as the ability of UK libraries to share responsibility with the British Library for coverage of research material depends to a large extent on such material being catalogued . 6 . New Technology 6.1 New technology has the potential to allow the British Library to offer services that contribute to , and underpin , lifelong learning . It will facilitate the distribution of services to the network of libraries in the UK ; to schools , colleges and universities ; to the workplace ; and to the home . The British Library can contribute to the national competitiveness and skills agenda by promoting literacy , numeracy and information skills . 6.2 Interoperability and bandwidth issues need careful consideration in the context of achieving inclusion . In view of the bandwidth and computers available to many users , the British Library should concentrate on delivering ' simple ' services as well as bandwidth-hungry digitisation projects . The services provided should be robust and reliable . 6.3 New technology will enhance the worldwide standing of the British Library . By studying best practice among the world's national library providers and embedding their own technology-based services within an international framework the British Library could open a gateway that would allow global access to resources at a local level . 6.4 At present there seems to be inadequate provision for the preservation of non-book materials . As more materials are produced in non-print format the British Library , as the national library , should be given the resources to preserve the literary and information heritage of the non-print materials produced in the UK . 6.5 BLDSC should minimise the paper-based aspects of the request and supply process . ' Digital signatures ' will obviate the need for signed copyright declarations and will facilitate a seamless supply model of document delivery . 7 . Other comments 7.1 The British Library must identify its contribution to an inclusive lifelong learning system by : enhancing access to learning ; enhancing the generation of content to learning networks ; enhancing networked access to resources . 8 . Conclusion 8.1 The Library Association appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Department for Culture , Media and Sport review of the British Library . The suggestions we have made are in the spirit of support for the overall aims of the British Library . 8.2 We fully recognise that many of our suggestions have resource implications and we would stress the need for the British Library to be funded adequately to fulfil its important national role . Within that context the Library must reassess its priorities between its traditional roles and the broader challenges of current Government policy . 8.3 We hope that our comments prove useful and welcome the possibility of further engagement in this debate .

"Announcing ... Lou Adler's Updated Rules for Winning the Talent Wars Lou Adler is known in HR departments and by recruiters nationwide as the thought leader who successfully transformed hiring into a systematic and scalable process that leaves little to chance . Financial companies , hospital and health care systems , name brand online companies and product manufacturers are among the numerous organizations that rely upon Adler's Performance-based HiringSM to win the talent wars . This summer , Adler has released the third edition of HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD , Wiley & Sons , July 2007 ( $ 29 . 95 ) , featuring the time-tested approach and integrating it into today's online world . Every hiring manager and every outside recruiter knows Lou Adler and The Adler Group as the source for improving their hiring success . Through onsite seminars , workshops , keynote speeches and webinars , The Adler Group ( www.adlerconcepts.com ) trains thousands of people every year to help improve sourcing , interviewing , hiring and retaining talent to help companies prosper . In HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD , Lou explains why the traditional methods of hiring and interviewing simply do not work . When the fundamentally flawed hiring process is compared to the Performance-based Hiring approach , it becomes crystal clear which is the better way to go . "" To succeed today , any kind of organization must take pro-active control of the talent supply chain . This is as necessary in the hiring area as any other critical sector of a company , "" says Lou Adler . "" HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD shows how . "" This up-to-date and fully revised edition of HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD features an in-depth look at the biggest change in the hiring arena since the introduction of the personal computer . Social networking sites , such as LinkedIn , MySpace , ZoomInfo and others have eliminated any secrecy in hiring and recruiting . Available positions that were once shared only with potential candidates are now two or three mouse clicks away from discovery by anyone - competitors as well as applicants . With changes in the hiring world happening at the rate of Internet innovations , keeping up with the rapid pace is a challenge . Knowing how to manage the information and the candidates who hold the same information cards as the hiring manager is critical . The same Wild West atmosphere that has put information on job openings on the fast track has also led to dramatic changes in the attitude of potential hires . There are fewer obstacles to keep employees in positions they find unfulfilling or unrewarding . The stigma of leaving companies has just about vanished , and changing jobs for short-term and superficial reasons and accepting counteroffers are now acceptable . Qualified candidates can easily find new jobs and new opportunities . Companies must address these changes and adapt their sourcing and hiring methods to maintain any competitive edge . HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD shows the reader how to find the best candidates , both active job seekers and passive browsers . Adler explores the use of multi-level sourcing , where pursuing a series of different channels ensures a constant flow of top candidates on an on-going basis . Identifying top candidates but failing to conduct good interviews condemns the hiring process to failure . Adler explains how two simple questions can be used to identify real performance potential , bringing the candidate into an authentic give-and-take discussion about the actual challenges and situations that the position entails , and determining how the person will perform , based on how they have handled similar situations in the past . Hint : the success is in the details . The methods described in HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD lead to a clear understanding of the candidate's problem-solving abilities , insights , intelligence , potential , vision and leadership skills . "" Hiring managers make mistakes when they allow presentation and emotion to overshadow performance , and this happens on a daily basis in offices around the globe , "" says Adler . "" The system that I have created and refined eliminates these mistakes by taking the candidate and the interviewers step by step through this simple , yet highly analytical process . "" For hiring managers , recruiters and anyone running a business or a department who wants to do a better job of finding , interviewing and hiring the best candidates , HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD is the only source they need . If you do not have a copy of HIRE WITH YOUR HEAD or would like additional information on Lou Adler , call Shari Goldstein at 631-595-7150 or shari@goldsteinPR.com and please provide your name , mailing address , name of publication and all other contact information .",7,7
"Today is a very exciting day at Guillotine Towers as it marks the release of my lovely friend Ankaret Wells ' latest novel, Firebrand which she has described as ' a steampunk fantasy romance inspired by Charlotte Bront's Angria novelettes, and featuring airships, plaid, a mechanical birdcage, de jure princesses, evil stepdaughters, and war by means of teapot. ' Who could possibly resist? To mark this occasion, Ankaret has very kindly written a post for us about ball scenes in novels. I love a good ballroom scene. Since all the way back before Shakespeare chronicled the events of the Capulets' costume party, writers have been enjoying the chance to dress their characters up and send them out for a formal dance, and I'm all for it. What's your favourite ball scene? Maybe it's from fiction -- perhaps the Netherfield ball where Darcy first gets the opportunity to demonstrate his pride and sparks off Elizabeth's prejudice. Or from history -- the Duchess of Richmond's ball on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo was immortalised by Millais and Thackeray and has lived on in historical novels and biographies ever since, and even Sharpe showed up there once. Or maybe it's from cinema -- Scarlett O'Hara's foot tapping longingly beneath her widow's weeds, or Holmes and Watson sweeping one another round the floor in the recent film Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows . As a writer, I love getting the chance to describe the broad sweep of a ballroom. The excited chatter, the musicians tuning up, the flickering light of candles or the smokier gleam of gaslight, the soft glow of silk and the flutter of muslins and, if we're lucky, the gold braid on military uniforms too. But ball scenes can also offer a chance for the characters to snatch more intimate moments. In Jane Austen's Emma , for example, the ball at the Crown Inn has an unpromising start, with the characters huddling around a fire on a raw evening in early May. But it leads to Emma and Mr Knightley taking a cautious, almost unconscious step forward from thinking of themselves as brother and sister and to Harriet being very grateful to dance at all. The Last Evening, James Tissot, c1885. Photo: Muse d'Orsay. From the introduction of the waltz in the early nineteenth century to the decline of social dancing in the late twentieth, there's a window of opportunity for the historical novelist to send their characters sweeping around the floor in one another's arms. The country and court dances that flourished before the waltz have their own delights. If you're writing anything set during the glittering days of the Renaissance, for example, it's hard to resist the Volta, in which the man lifts the woman clean off her feet and thrusts his thigh under hers. Queen Elizabeth danced it with the Earl of Leicester. For young women whose opportunities for exercise mostly consisted of walking, with riding thrown in at one end of the social spectrum and housework at the other, the chance to work off some energy through the skipping and marching and changing of partners of an old-fashioned country dance must have been exhilarating. It also offered an opportunity for conversation away from the ears of chaperones -- perhaps with a variety of gentlemen. But when the waltz arrives, the opportunities for hero and heroine become more alluring still. In Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan's memoir The Glitter And The Gold she describes how circumscribed her life was as a young woman in Gilded Age New York. (Possibly she had reason to make those days sound even more confining than they actually were, as she later attained an annulment of her marriage to the 9th Duke of Marlborough on the grounds that her mother had forced her into it -- but that doesn't stop The Glitter And The Gold being a page-turner) When a young woman was brought up in the expectation of barely so much as touching a man's arm until they arrived at the altar, the prospect of that arm clasping her around the waist and whirling her round the dancefloor must have been truly exhilarating. The Woman of Fashion, James Tissot, c1883-5. Photo: Private Collection. Giving your characters a chance to dance together lets them notice one another's bodies, not just with glances across the crowded room but with the other senses too. (Well, maybe not taste -- unless they escape out onto a balcony or into a conservatory, and then good luck to them!) The way a person moves, the touch of their hand, even the scent of tuberose perfume or of 'leather, tobacco and clean male sweat' can do a lot to bring a book to tingling life. Even in modern romances, the ballroom scene isn't quite dead. The hero and heroine can hit the dancefloor at a nightclub or maybe just revolve together to the sound of Ella Fitzgerald or Frank Sinatra while the moon shines through the window of the hero's swanky apartment. And in science fiction and fantasy, imagination is the only limit. Suave wizards bowing across a polished dancefloor? Steam-powered automaton dancing partners? The Antigravity Volta? Bring it on! Long live the ballroom scene, whatever form it takes! Hurray, thanks Ankaret and good luck with your book launch! Firebrand is available as a paperback from Lulu and for Kindle from Amazon . Go and buy! 5 Responses to ""Ball Scenes -- a guest post by Ankaret Wells"" Oooh! For me it's the Christmas dance (like a ball, but smaller scale) near the end of Hardy's ""Far From The Madding Crowd"". By this stage in the book the host, Mr Boldwood, is so lovesick over Bathsheba, our heroine, he's basically become the worst kind of stalker -- and the party is entirely as a means of pushing her into agreeing to get engaged to him at last... and of course, INTRIGUE and DRAMA ensues. ALSO, completely on the other side of things, the scene in the Hunger Games trilogy where Katniss dances with Plutarch Heavensbee at the Victory Banquet is pretty tense too! She doesn't really know what to make of him, and then he shows her his watch, and it's a coded signal that he supports her rebellion against the evil regime they live under -- the watch is his way of giving her a Major Plot Hint of what's coming I loved that scene in Catching Fire too -- way to ratchet up the tension even more when it's already almost at breaking point! To my shame, I have to confess I haven't read Far From The Madding Crowd -- a friend did it at A-level and used to rant about how much he hated it, and it put me off ever trying it. Maybe I should give it another go? I'm a member of the Whitechapel Society and London Historians and also a reviewer for the Historical Novel Society. I shouldn't really need to say this but all the written content on this site is my own work and copyrighted to me so please ask before using elsewhere.

I can also be friended on Goodreads , where I have an author profile with links to my books. The Secret Diary of a Princess When I'm not being a vegan and daydreaming about cupcakes, knitting and marrying Aidan Turner, I am a writer! My first book The Secret Diary of a Princess: a novel of Marie Antoinette, about the early life of Marie Antoinette and her transformation from a gawky Austrian princess to the fashionable, elegant Madame la Dauphine is OUT NOW and available to buy rather thrillingly as a Kindle book from Amazon UK or Amazon US . Blood Sisters My second novel, Blood Sisters was inspired by the stories of several intrepid, courageous and amazing women who lived through the upheaval of the French Revolution, in particular the Princesse Joseph de Monaco, Emilie de Saint-Amaranthe, Princesse Rosalie Lubomirska and Lucile Desmoulins, all of whom followed very different destinies.' 'The French Revolution was a period of political upheaval, and of terrifying and appalling violence. I wanted to interweave that political background with my story so my heroines weren't just passively sitting at home waiting for men to do everything, but getting out there and making history themselves.' Blood Sisters is an historical epic with a romantic, adventurous edge, and out now for Kindle from Amazon US and Amazon UK . Before the Storm My third novel of POSH DOOM and iniquity is a tale of passion, woe, betrayal and true love based on The Buccaneers by Edith Wharton and played against the glittering, exciting and yet often dangerous backdrop of Georgian London, Versailles and Revolutionary France.

"I think that it is safe to assume that if you are reading an article under this heading that you are more than likely looking to open an online store for the first time... If so you are probably looking for a way to start an online business - perhaps you are looking for a way to make money from home. An online business is an excellent way to start making money online and start a home business. And if you don't have a lot of experience in computer programming or online sales and marketing then you will need to find a method of opening an online store that is cheap, easy and won't cause you too much frustration while you learn about the ins and outs of online business and maybe even business itself. A QUICK WARNING... Starting an online business can be a difficult and daunting project for the uninitiated home business entrepreneur. There are a lot of people making money out of newbies like you (and I used to be one of those people too - and they made some money out of me, so I know!) by offering so called COMPLETE PACKAGE online stores that come complete with stock and support so that all you have to do is make a monthly fee and they will take care of the rest. You get your own site and your own customers - but beware - there is a reason that someone would be willing to let you stock a store with their goods for a fee when they could be selling their stuff themselves and that is that it is more profitable for them to collect a monthly fee from you and hundreds if not thousands of people like you who want to make a start in online business and make money at home, but don't know where to go to do is successfully. These people make a lot of money from the websites that they create and you will probably not make much from the stock that you sell - and if you do you can be sure that the people who stock your site are making money on that sold stock aswell. Better to start your own site from scratch and keep all the money for yourself. But how to do that with little or no experience? EBAY - THE WORLD'S ONLINE MARKETPLACE Start on eBay! Seriously, the eBay market is huge - imagine your local mall. It is packed with all sorts of stores, cafes, department stores, boutiques etc etc and because there are so many different stores all operating together in one place there are thousands of people who go there daily to browse around and have a good time. Well, eBay is just such a place. If you haven't yet been there (and I bet you have!) then go and check it out for yourself. There are thousands if not millions of items for sale from ebooks to antiques to fashion and cars. AND there are MILLIONS and BILLIONS of people looking at these items every day! If you were selling something - then wouldn't you want to sell it in a mall where there were millions of people browsing around looking? Of course because out of those million people you would get hundreds and thousands browsing in your store. If you want to go online with your home business or extend your existing business online then eBay is the best place to start because you WILL get customers! GUARANTEED! HOW TO GET STARTED Opening an eBay account is quick, easy and FREE. You can get started in minutes and all you need is a valid email address. Once you have started then familiarize yourself with the site and buy stuff! eBay has very strict policies about what they allow people to sell on their site and so you should expect that what is for sale is genuine and in good working order. If you are not sure and if the seller doesn't give a good enough description of anything to satisfy you then move on to his/her competition - there is plenty of it - or ask questions. eBay is an environment where communication is easy and encouraged. If you have not bought or sold anything on eBay then go and get started! GETTING AN ONLINE BUSINESS RUNNING You have probably bought on eBay before and may have even sold a few things, but setting up an online business on eBay to make money from home is something that you should plan and carefully consider. It is not easy to go from selling bits and pieces from around the house to selling regularly and profitably. There are three things that you should consider: 1. You, 2. Your Customers, & 3. Your Suppliers. 1. CONSIDERING YOURSELF AND YOUR BUSINESS FIRST Why are you going into business - especially online business? You probably have a vision in mind when you think about starting and building a business online. Do you want to be able to work from home and earn more money to supplement your full-time income or do you want to replace your full-time J.O.B. altogether? The vision that you have for yourself and your business is the first thing that you will need to get straight before you start. This is not unlike the sort of vision that you should have for any business or endeavor. Work out from the start when you want to end up - even how and when you want to retire and you will be on track from the first day. While you are running your business you should regularly refer back to the vision that you had at the start and reconcile your progress and direction. One of the biggest weaknesses that I have in operating my own online businesses is that I started with the vision of getting online to free up my time for my family - but as I get excited about new projects and discover new markets and methods of doing business online I plug myself into my computer for days and weeks at a time and tend to ignore my vision of having free time. I guess it is a bit of an obsessive trait that I have but it isn't what I got into it for and I have to remind myself that I wanted more time and need to remember that. You might have your own concerns and will want to be able to have something to refer to when your online business tries to sidetrack you from your dreams - they can tend to have a life of their own, but you mustn't let them take over! YOU ARE THE BOSS. 2. CONSIDER YOUR CUSTOMERS If you don't offer people something that THEY want then no matter how hard you work or how passionate you are about your business or your product - no one is ever going to buy it! You need to know your customers and their wants and needs to be successful. Do some research and ask yourself if you really have their interests in mind when you open your online store. They may want the same things as you or they may not - you can be sure that they will want to get excellent customer service, a quality product and a good price. Concentrate on two of these three - all three can be impossible and impractical. After all, you don't see huge price wars in the Luxury Car industry. These guys are all about quality and service - not price. Work out what you are about and then stick to it. 3. GET GOOD, RELIABLE SUPPLIERS eBay is a great place to start online because you can work your way into online business safely from the comfort of your own home and selling your own goods or things that you can get locally from yard sales or from local retail sales or from friends and family. This is a great reason why eBay should be number one on your list of ways to start an online business. When you start getting more experience however you are going to want to find a product or products that you can sell regularly and profitably and you will need to find suppliers who can fulfill your needs professionally. Finding wholesalers who will sell to you as an online retailer may be difficult and there are plenty of 'middlemen/women' out there who will sell you something that they have got from their wholesaler at mark ups that you could be putting into your own pocket if you were to go to the wholesaler directly. If you are serious about taking advantage of the profit that is out there to be made selling online then the only place that you should go is to WorldWideBrands.com! I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH. This is a site that you can register with and get access to thousands of wholesalers and dropshippers who have been prescreened by WWB to make sure that they will sell to online businesses and eBay sellers. Can I repeat that. All of the wholesalers and dropshippers on the WWB directory have been interviewed by WWB and have indicated that they are more than happy to sell to online businesses. They are literally waiting for your call. WWB also operates a fantastic state-of-the-art search engine so that you can find the wholesalers and dropshippers that are selling what you need - or you can search the database to find great products that you would like to sell. It is easy and the one time registration fee will more than save you a lot of trouble and disappointment trying to find reputable and reasonable wholesalers yourself. I KNOW! ...OPTIMIZING AND REALIZING THE ULTIMATE ONLINE BUSINESS! eBay is a great start for your online business and you will be able to make money from home quickly. It is also a great way to run a full-time business from home and many MANY people do - millions! Once you have some good experience from eBay sales, however you should start to learn about the advantages of venturing further out into the www. There is excellent money to be made from online marketing business and from developing and selling your own information products and physical products. Starting your own website and your own online business completely independent of eBay is easy once you learn how to generate traffic (that is, bring customers from the search engines to your website). When you start to venture off eBay and into business independently you will be able to fully automate your online programs so that they begin to earn you money in your sleep! There are plenty of excellent resources out there and I recommend (again - sorry for sounding like a broken record!) that you start on eBay buying cheap ebooks that will show you how to start optimizing your eBay store and how to get involved in online marketing. Start with eBay because the books selling there are some of the best and you will be able to avoid some of the junk that is floating around in cyberspace. Don't waste your time if you can help it. Pay for good advice if you know that it is going to save you a lot of research and frustration - cyberspace is a HUGE place and you want to learn to navigate your way around efficiently (remember your vision - I be it doesn't include you reading endlessly looking for the proverbial needle). Anyway, Follow the simple steps above, get good advice and be confident! Your online business is going to be great! ",2,2
"Several years ago , here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge . And the idea 's pretty simple . Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow . The marshmallow has to be on top . And , though it seems really simple , it 's actually pretty hard , because it forces people to collaborate very quickly . And so I thought that this was an interesting idea , and I incorporated it into a design workshop . And it was a huge success . And since then , I 've conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and there 's something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I 'd like to share some of them with you . So , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task . They talk about it , they figure out what it 's going to look like , they jockey for power , then they spend some time planning , organizing . They sketch and they lay out spaghetti They spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures and then , finally , just as they 're running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and Ta-da ! they admire their work . But what really happens , most of the time , is that the "" ta-da "" turns into an "" uh-oh , "" because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse . So there are a number of people who have a lot more "" uh-oh "" moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school . ( Laughter ) They lie , they cheat , they get distracted , and they produce really lame structures . And of course there are teams that have a lot more "" ta-da "" structures , and , among the best , are recent graduates of kindergarten . ( Laughter ) And it 's pretty amazing . As Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they 're the most interesting structures of them all . So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Why ? What is it about them ? And Peter likes to say that , "" None of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of Spaghetti Inc. "" Right . They do n't spend time jockeying for power . But there 's another reason as well . And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right . And then they execute on it . And then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time , and what happens ? It 's a crisis . Sound familiar ? Right . What kindergarteners do differently , is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix ill built prototypes along the way . So designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process . And with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what does n ' t work . So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let 's look at how different teams perform . So the average for most people is around 20 inches , business schools students , about half of that , lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults . Who does the very best ? Architects and engineers , thankfully . ( Laughter ) 39 inches is the tallest structure I 've seen . And why is it ? Because they understand triangles and self-re-enforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures . So CEOs , a little bit better than average . But here 's where it gets interesting . If you put you put an executive admin . on the team , they get significantly better . ( Laughter ) It 's incredible . You know , you look around , you go , "" Oh , that team 's going to win . "" You can just tell beforehand . And why is that ? Because they have special skills of facilitation . They manage the process , they understand the process . And any team who manages and pays a close attention to work will significantly improve the team's performance . Specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination [ that ] leads to strong success . If you have 10 teams that typically perform , you 'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures . And I tried something interesting . I thought , let 's up the ante once . So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team . So what do you think happened to these design students ? What was the result ? Here 's what happened . Not one team had a standing structure . If anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they could have taken home the prize . So , is n't it interesting that high stakes have a strong impact . We did the exercise again with the same students . What do you think happened then ? So now they understand the value of prototyping . So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best . They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time . So there 's deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success . So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ? And the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects . And what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions . Because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , does n ' t it . The challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , common stance to build the right prototype . And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise . And those of you who are interested , may want to go to marshmallowchallenge . com . It 's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows . There 's step-by-step instructions on this . There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system . There 's world records on this as well . And the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport . It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand . And , sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an "" uh-oh "" moment to a "" ta-da "" moment . And that can make a big difference . Thank you very much . ( Applause ) </content",5,5

In response to a request for help in rebutting these reasons (and as suggested by Jack Vinson ) , I am asking for short responses (with or without a link to supporting resources) to each of these points to build an armoury of responses to use with sceptical managers.  Please leave your contribution below. Social media are an extension of the Internet and the Web, and are becoming embedded in our work and leisure time. If the Net is a fad, then so are social media -- place your bets. In the long-term, everything is a fad.  Does that mean it isn't helpful?  The question is whether this particular fad has any value to us today.  The argument I like the most is that social media (or Enterprise 2.0 or ""this technology"") gives us an ability to return to the heart of what organizations should be about: people working with each other.  Social media is a great way to help people connect and engage with each other, especially when they no longer share physical space. Everything starts off as a fad. I think the statistics speak for themselves, as presented in Erik Qualman's video, Social Media Revolution (v2). A huge number of people are using these tools in their daily lives and it is having a significant impact on all types of activities -- personal, business as well as learning. Social media may be a fad, but in this day and age, its also accessible while on the move. It may have started as a fad but it's gone well past that now. Anyway, a lot of things that we use on a daily basis started like that too (eg the Internet, e-mail, computers, IT, instant coffee, central heating, gas, electricity ...) While specific tools may be more or less popular at any given time or in a particular industry,  the principles of social media are here to stay. Conversations, transparency, relationships, authenticity, and making information easily accessible and available are not only important aspects of social media, they are increasingly becoming the way that the most successful businesses thrive in the new economy. The genie is out and he's not getting back in the bottle. that can't be answered just yet, only time will tell. If so do you want to be left behind and not know anything about it? Communication has been at the core of being human since before the campfire.  Augmenting our capabilities with technology, using tools, yeah, that's not new.  So using tools to facilitate communication is just natural evolution.  Was the computer a fad? The internet a fad?  Busted. Yes, yes, I know. I have been hearing and reading about this one since early 2000, when I was first exposed to social software tools (Community wikis, in this case), and fast forward 10 years later (Yes, 10 years later!) we are still talking about it. If that's a fad then I wish there would be plenty more of them, I am afraid. Social Software has been with us since 1997 and growing stronger than ever, to the point where plenty of people are spending more time in social networking activities displacing even something so pervasive as email is . Yes, indeed, we would have to start saying that email, too, is a fad, don't you think? ! (It's been there for over 40 years already!) This excuse for not using social media is based fully on fear. Here's what management is thinking: we'll pour resources into this, we'll spend a bunch of  time and money on it, and people won't even use it. They'll go back to what they always do, and 3 years from now we'll do this whole dance again to different music.Here's where you have to be prepared to counter-act the impact social media ""experts"" may have had on your decision makers. Pick one initiative that is important to your management. Explain how using social media can impact the bottom line, and show how easy & inexpensive it will be to implement your plan. Give them something easy that they don't have to be married to -- maybe a listening program.If they really think social media a fad, give them something lightweight and low-risk so they can try it out. But make sure you measure everything you can, and show them some fantastic results. With growth rates, reach, penetration, engagement and network-effect metrics like social media has had, our business should wish to be such a fad! I can't see our board of directors complaining if we hit numbers like that... This one has very little connection for me.  Within the organization there is no ""message"" to control.  And outside the organization, plenty of other people are handling the message, both the company message as well as all the messages customers have about the company (which are often shared with these tools). Too much control = stifled imagination. Control is a myth ; there has never been any real control.  How do you control the conversations people have on the phone, in emails, in the restaurant, in the pub after work? We need to make a corporate paradigm shift from controlling to facilitating and validating similar to TV news media. If organisations have a message, why not control it?  Social media gets the message (and instant feedback) to the big wide world instantly Actually, it's completely the opposite -- the use of social media by its very nature removes or negates control. You're right -- it's about controlling the message. But HOW you control it has changed. You can try brute force and rigid boundaries, but that doesn't work very well anymore. Just ask BP. In a world where information and the tools for sharing it are freely available, you will never be able to control everything that's said about you. But you CAN listen and respond in a way that you were never able to before. You can find out where the problems are, what people are complaining about and then, through your responses, you can control how these issues are perceived. You can't control the message, but through social media, you CAN control perceptions. is naive in the extreme, anyone who thinks they can control information has no job in management If it is are you using the channels available to you and the employees? Just because social media is banned at work does not mean employees don't have access to it at all. They are on it whether you like it or not. And if you are indeed worried about controlling the message, are you on the same channels are your employees are? You can't control the message, and social media isn't going to change that.  They  have phones, email, hallway conversations, parking lot conversations, and the social media cigarette break .   I won't even go into why you'd want to control the message, because that comes up later in the list. This is an interesting one, for sure! Jane talks about it as a myth . Actually, I would go one step further. Control has always been, and still is, an illusion. Controlling your knowledge workers and their actions is an impossible task to do for anyone, more than anything else, because those knowledge workers are the first ones who know exactly how to put a stop to that control if it jeopardises their own identity and personal privacy: they would leave the company. As simple as that. Oh, and the same thing happens with security, for that matter. This one is about fear as well. And its pretty easy to overcome -- just start showing them examples of how people are talking about your products and company. Good things if you can find them, bad if you have to. People are already talking about you. The question is -- do you want to be involved when and where your customers decide to share. Do your stakeholders want to counteract the negative, and reinforce the positive? Or do they want to pretend that no one is talking at all?If they decide to put their toe in the water and try social media, record any outstanding interactions that take place between you and your customers. Show them how their efforts are paying off! When the context changes, that changes both the semantics and pragmatics of the message. An old corporate voice and corporate persona, authoritatively delivered through controlled channels, may have seemed solid and genuine in the past, but today it seems staged, forced, inauthentic, shallow and static. People expect to have conversations with real individuals working within a ""brand hive"" -- trust agents who represent the brand, but do so as individual speakers. The trained TV voice and polished print copy of yesterday is material for parody today. 8 -- Employees will goof off What looks like goofing off, such as Twitter , may actually be knowledge work. And, so?  How is this different from all the other ways we have of relaxing and taking a break?  In business people are expected to be available nearly all the time, so we also need to give them a break if they need it, whether that is heading down the road for a coffee or checking their favorite blog.  And by the way, many of those blogs have a business connection. Employees who will goof off (or abuse SM) are already goofing off & u don't know it. It's already a selection issue. Now u'll have eyes into it & can take appropriate documented action. Don't employees goof off now?  What about sick days, extended loo breaks etc?  What might be seen as goofing off could also be work -- research, networking, product evaluation to name but a few If by 'goof off' you mean ""a person who is habitually lazy or does less than their fair share of work"" then I don't see how this is possible when they are busy using social media for well-intentioned purposes You're right. Staff WILL goof off. But here's something great about social media that I don't think you've realized. Did you know with social media you can actually monitor goofing off even BETTER? I can't tell if you played solitaire on your laptop unless I actually catch you doing it. But I CAN tell if you uploaded your vacation photos or played Farmville on Facebook during work hours. I don't know if you spent an hour on the phone to your sister. But I CAN see if you were tweeting about lunch and your favorite episode of Glee when you were supposed to be working on that report. See? Social media is actually your greatest dream -- documented proof of all the ways your staff is screwing around! The faster you get them on there, the quicker you'll be able to prove what you've suspected all along! If your employees goof off it's your fault as a manager; either give them something more interesting to do, motivate them, accept an element of goofing as part of life or find people who don't goof off. If employees have to goof off they will, whether they have access to social media at work or not. If you are managing your work allocation and performance management well, and have the right business measurements in place, it doesn't really matter whether employees goof off or not. If you are measuring the time they are spending on activities rather than the results they are expected to achieve, you are probably a lawyer or a consultant billing by the hour. I can't comment on lawyers but as a consultant, you better focus on results or you'll be out of business. This is redundant with the previous one. They'll still have phones, email, paper, etc, e.g. lots of ways to goof off.  They'll goof off regardless if you haven't given them meaning in the work, but social media won't affect it, yay or nay. Of course! We have been doing that for centuries and we will continue to do that for many more to come! It's part of our human nature when we lack the motivation and involvement to remain engaged with what we do. When businesses have managed to wear off our passion for our jobs and instead treat us as resources , not even human, that's what you can expect. It's a fair game.Like I said, we are going to continue to goof off for many decades to come, but, to be honest with you, if we would want to do that we wouldn't need to make use of social networking sites in the first place. We have got other means of doing it much more successfully: email, personal phone calls, the water cooler breaks, extended breakfast & lunch breaks, late arrivals at work, and a long etc. etc.If you don't want your employees to goof off, treat them with respect, trust them, empower them to co-share that responsibility of running a business, treasure and nurture their professionalism, because, after all, haven't you hired a bunch of professionals to do the job in the first place? If not, don't blame the employees; you may need to look into the HR hiring process altogether from scratch Employees already goof off, we've never needed social media for that (wall and what ever the comparable windows command was -- anyone?)Plus now most people can now access social media on their phones. Why not set expectations for how you want your employees to use social sites, and let them connect? I remember in the 1990s when companies were wondering whether or not they should allow employees to have web access. Is work even imaginable today without it? But the worries were the same. If employees have enough time to goof off, then maybe the culprit is mandatory work hours. Try instituting a Results-Only-Work-Environment, where people don't have to work a set number of hours at all -- they just have to deliver what is needed from them. Like a free market for goods, if people are free to invest how they spend their time, many will become intensely focused and productive at work, in order to carve out extra time in their week for non-work tasks. If people are goofing off at work, it may be because they are stuck there for 40 hours whether they are super-productive or not. 7 -- Social media is a time-waster Not if you use some methods and processes (like PKM ) to make sense of all those networks [that's how I'm able to write this post so quickly]. And the 25% of time people spend hunting around on the corporate intranet is a good use of time?  Maybe if I could ask a question and get a direct answer, I could be more productive. Networking is productive Wait!  We've done this one before .  People get distracted by all types of things, especially if they are not motivated by their work.  The answer is to help them make their job more interesting or rewarding; not ban social media. Email used to be a time waster?? Or was it a time saver?? Social media can improve efficiency -- knowledge at your fingertips!  It's no more of a time waster than watching the birds in the sky How can sharing knowledge, promoting a business, finding like-minded people be a waste of time? Actually, used appropriately, social media is a time saver. I can spend an hour searching through my desktop and the company intranet for an answer to a question or I can post it to Twitter and get a response in a few minutes. I can spend 15 minutes trying to find the latest version of that report or I can go to the company wiki and know that what I find there is where things are at. Social media is a time waster when we don't know how to use it properly. When we do, it can be one of the most effective ways to get work done . Really . See point 8. They already have social media (email, phones, etc).  Are they wasting time with them, or using them to work?  Same argument as before: they'll waste time or not, depending on the work environment, not the tool.  You have to make the environment meaningful and valuable, regardless of the technology! Of course! Have you noticed how, every so often, we have got these wonderful studies that claim millions of dollars have been wasted by all of that time we seem to spend on social networking sites? How those social interactions help us decrease our productivity substantially? Well, how about if we tackle the issues where we would need to: how are business keeping their employees networked, connected, motivated and engaged to do their jobs so that they don't bump into time wasters? Most importantly, when are we going to have studies done on the huge amount of money and time lost when knowledge workers can't get their job done because they can't find that expert or that piece of information while they are still trapped inside their teams and organisational silos when they know and realise that within a matter of minutes, using social networks, they would be able to find them successfully? I think this excuse is thrown up when some over-zealous social media expert does not tie social media to business processes. I don't know about the rest of you, but we're busy where I work. I could have a clone, and still not get to everything I need to do. This one was easy to get around though. When I started doing social media, I was doing course development for EMC's Ionix products. This is a space that is very fast-moving, and the way I kept up on things was RSS feeds.I explained that although it took time to set it up, once I had all my feeds I could scan for what was important to what I was working on. But even more important than the information were the contacts I made. I'd leave comments on blogs, send people emails, etc to connect to people. When I'd get stuck on a project, I knew where  to go for information (and who to go to). When they needed training information, I was their ""in"" to our dept.Social media ended up saving me time, and this was an easy, practical thing to explain. Social media includes instant access to experts and enthusiasts on any topic imaginable, worldwide, with turnaround times measured in minutes. I need to waste more of my time that way, and rely less on plodding intranet searches. How about a few: connecting people in the organization; pulling people away from their over-stuffed email boxes; helping to answer questions on-the-spot.  My participation with blogging and other social media has been deeply fulfilling and has helped me make business connections that I would have never made (or never even found).  I'll let someone else talk about the benefits for public-facing social media. Have you seen the resources available around the topic ""Social Media for your business""?  Have you seen how many businesses use it? Then how come, loads of businesses are using it to promote themselves, their products and their services? The last time I checked, business was about interacting with customers and getting work done efficiently and effectively. Social media can help you do both. Social media is a tool, like a phone or a laptop. And, like a phone or a laptop, it can be used for personal or business-related reasons.  If you don't see the business purpose behind its use, then you need to do a little more reading . If your customers aren't on social media, investors aren't on social media, stakeholders are not on social media, employees are not on social media, competition is not on social media, and you don't believe in continual learning, keeping track of market trends etc., then yeah, perhaps social media serves no business purpose for you. Again, they already have email. Do you use email for business?  What might they do with the ability to ask questions, provide hints, suggestions, and pointers?  To work together on a problem?  Business is communication. Of course, not! That's why social media doesn't humanise your enterprise, does it? Or is it quite the opposite? How about flattening the organisation, breaking down silos, helping knowledge workers find both content and experts much easier, facilitating serendipitous knowledge discoveries, bringing further up clarity, visibility and openness in both how people collaborate and share their knowledge? How about being one of the major drivers in helping build trust levels by tapping into the crucial realm of social capital , which we all know is eventually what drives business nowadays (When was the last time you purchased a product without trusting the vendor? If you have, I think you should question that one first, I'm afraid)? Yes, indeed, social media has no business purpose, or does it? Again, I think so many of the early adopters came through using buzz-words and dreamy scenarios that people with mature business processes were spooked. You can tie this back to reason number 10 (social media is a fad).The reason to use social media has to be tied to what a business does to make money. This means social media is not going to look the same for everyone. If you want to lose your audience when pitching social media, don't tie it to any important projects. Don't explain how it can save or earn money. If you can't say specifically how social media can be used to impact the business, you're just asking to get this excuse thrown at you. That's equivalent to saying that expertise has no buisness purpose, since social media is becoming a primary channel for virtuous cycles of expertise sharing. 5, 7 and 8 are all saying the same thing, though this one says it more clearly.  If you don't trust your employees, why are they employed?  And if you don't trust them, I am fairly sure they know it already.  Give them some appropriate, simple guidelines and let them have at it. Employees are more productive if trusted Why don't you fire them then! Seriously though, trust is a two-way thing, and social media is actually a good way to build trust. This article says: "" Social media marketing is a long-term strategy of relationship building to get a consumer to invest in your product. Using similar relationship building ideas will prove to be an effective long-term strategy for getting your employees to invest more of themselves in your company."" This reveals a selection and hiring issue that needs to be dealt with there, not by preventing something that can. Advance your corporate strategies and bottom line. Deal with the root cause, not the symptom. If you don't trust them, don't hire them, or if you have already hired them, get rid of them! Oh yes they can if you treat them right. Make them think you don't trust them then they will go behind your back. You are SO right here. Employees simply cannot be trusted. If you aren't careful, they might run off and do something crazy like set up a Twitter account that in a few short months changes your company's image from a joke to a customer service case study in excellence .  Better that they play solitaire on their company-approved laptop. At least you know what they're up to. If you can't trust of your employees, why are you in the business that needs employees? Do you trust them enough to let them talk on phones, use email? Then you can trust them with social media. Yeah sure there are sensitivities of using social media on which you should coach your employees, just as you would to use the phone or email. The video talks about employees can't be trusted to not put up photos on the office party. Well what's the harm? It's a great opportunity to tell the world what a fun place to work your organization is, and therefore attract more talent for your organization, especially when the workforce is getting younger (also see point 4). See previous responses.  The tool doesn't matter.  Either they can be trusted, or they can't (and if they can't, you've failed, not them). Oh dear, if your employees can't be trusted, why is is then that you have hired them in the first place? That's like you trust that robber with your house keys to take care of the house while you go on vacation for three weeks!! Really? You don't trust your employees? Whether you like it or not, they are your brand, and I do seriously think you should probably take much better care of your brand than no trusting it altogether, don't you think?In fact, trusting your employees and treating them with respect, care and appreciation will help you take your business into a new ground, one where they will become trustworthy enough to engage in conversations with your customers to keep them happy and engaged. Now, how is that for a bad thing? Is it? Trust them. They are your bloodstream, the DNA of your business, whether you like it or not, so you might as well treat them with respect and treasure their passion and commitment, because otherwise when you may need that blood transfusion to survive you may not longer have a donor... This one is silly. I work in a training organization for a vendor company, and our instructors and developers understand and know the company's positioning on the products with which they work. We also know our support policies and what we can and can't say to our audiences. Our organization trusts us to be alone in a room with customers, sometimes at the customer's own site!Pointing this out usually helps. But then figuring out how to make sure social media fits into existing processes also helps. If you set the expectation that social media is just another way to share information, and all the same rules about sharing information apply, people will understand what to do. If this is true, you have bigger problems than your social media policy! Plus, if you can train your sales, customer service, marketing and PR people to be careful about how they represent the company, you can train everybody in the same way, and inculcate a culture that defines a new social media-savvy ""common sense"" for how members of your organization represent it. What happened to the old adage ""the customer is always right?""  If you want their customs, go to where they hang out -- millenials or not -- you might be surprised! As a 'Baby Boomer' I'm not caving into anyone. Is it just the Millenials who are using social media? According to these stats , the 35-55 age group is making some pretty healthy use of it, too. That's why social networking now outranks email in terms of how Americans are spending their time online. So don't do it for the Millenials. Do it for all of your workforce. Enough demographic studies show that in India the workforce is getting younger. Wouldn't you want to create an environment that your workforce relates to and enjoys? Would you want to create an environment that your workforce finds stifling? You could potentially use social media access as a retention strategy. The generational differences myth has already been busted.  The evidence is that what the different generations want out of work really isn't that different. What workers want are ways to achieve meaningful goals, and they want whatever tools will help them.  If there are new tools, get those tools into their hands! Erik Qualman's Socialnomics video refutes these ideas quite nicely, as do the regularly-updated statistics on sites like Brian Solis's blog and Pingdom. Of course! Why should you? After all the vast majority of your workforce are all baby boomers, who will be working still for another 20 to 25 years to come, right? Oh, wait, that's not that accurate anymore, I am afraid, is it? Baby boomers are already retiring, and in two to three years it would be those younger generations the ones that will outnumber, by far, those older generations. But, it gets even more interesting, still ...Those older generations are starting to retire and leave the workplace, and all of the huge amount of knowledge they have accumulated over the course of decades is going away with them. Who are they going to transfer it to, before they go? What tools are they going to use? Email? Instant Messaging? The phone? Oh dear, that doesn't sound like an interesting outlook into take into account in the next few months, does it? Whether we like it or not, the younger generational working style relying more and more on social tools is here to stay, so the sooner we adopt it and embrace it, the better. The much more amount of critical knowledge we would be capable of not just preserving, but also reusing and augmenting further. Why would you want to reinvent the wheel from scratch once again? Haven't we all done that far too many times already? If you don't cave into those demands, I think very soon it would be yourself the one looking out for a new job out there, one where your next boss may be one of those young millennials working for a company that decided to adapt and change to that new and refreshing working style... Up to you. Really. This is a direct result of the digital immigrant (blah blah blah) brainwashing that social media experts tried. Millennials aren't demanding anything  -- at least not the ones I work with. The ones I've interacted with are interested in learning how current processes work, and then finding ways to improve those processes.The thing that really makes me nuts about this is that I work with folks who have used social technology since it was invented, heck most of us have deployed the systems on which social platforms run. Some people I know have used instant messaging, online communities, etc for 20 years! If you try to tell them that social media is something new that only 20 year-olds can do, they will tune you right out. The only thing that is new is the technology -- but people (like me) have been using these tools for a long, long time. Generational arguments are often intellectually lazy, I think. There are a few researchers who actually do the sociological work to unearth generational characteristics, but most people complaining about generations are really complaining about the youth and relative inexperience of any cohort of young employees. The complainers, when they were young, generated the same shock and horror among their elders too. Also, generational arguments get stale fast. Milennials have mortgages and kids now. The rhetoric is lagging the reality now. Excellent.  And how are they sharing that knowledge? E-mail traps knowledge and doesn't help it spread.  The same goes for document management.  Social media adds to the ability of people to find each other -- people who can help solve problems and get those projects out the door. Prove it. I don't think so.  Public social media tools are being used  (often unknowingly by managers) in organisations to provide teams with sharing and collaborative functionality that are lacking in many enterprise systems, since they are fundamentally top-down content-delivery systems. Cool, so you will understand how social media makes it easier to serve this objective. They may share as effectively as they  have been able to, but why would you limit them to what has been possible?  Why not empower them with what is now possible? I can't imagine a worker today who would agree with that statement. We all know the frustration of not being able to find information/resources we need when we need them, the clunkiness of email as a means of collaboration, and the general inefficiency and ineffectivess of our linear, assembly-line approach to information management and communication. The oft-cited proof of how wrong this assertion is is the relative effectiveness of search engines like Google compared to internal searching capabilities. A wise man once said "" E-mail is where knowledge goes to die "", so if you think that your knowledge workers have been sharing their knowledge efficiently through email, I guess you would need to think about it, once again. It's not happening. Yes, I realise you may have all of that wonderful explicit knowledge captured in knowledge sharing repositories and that you may have a rather solid content management repository strategy, but did you know that only accounts for about 5% of the total amount of knowledge and information generated by your workforce? Indeed, that small fraction.It's not such a bad thing to complement such wonderful CMS strategies with the adoption of social software tools where tacit knowledge could flourish in a rather rich environment and get combined with all of that Intellectual Capital your business has been capturing for decades. Why neglect the fact that most of the work done today gets carried out through those informal tacit knowledge exchanges where individuals are more in control of their work and knowledge flows giving them an opportunity to manage, much better than anyone did in the recent past, their own personal knowledge? Why neglect the best of both worlds when they complement each other so nicely? Remember, right now, right as we speak, you are already missing out on 95% of all of the knowledge ""available"" out there. Maybe leaders actually believe this is true. If you know your organization, you know where the gaps are. Would people have more free time to work on higher-order issues if some knowledge sharing were moved to a social platform instead of email? What ways can social media be used to make knowledge sharing even more effective? That's interesting. What about surprising reserves of knowledge and skill that your employees have which are not called upon in their job role on their team? Social intranet technologies help you draw out these reserves of talent that the formal organizational structure obscures. Why limit their contributions to what your team structure presumes people are supposed to know? There's a lot more talent there for your organization to tap, distributed in ways you do not know about. If we don't start leveraging our talent pool more broadly and nimbly, how will we fare against competitors who do? 2 -- You'll get viruses Not if you use a Mac Dave Snowden : ""Since I've left IBM I've had fewer virus attacks working in an open Web environment than I did in a secure corporate environment."" Another non-issue.  Teach people responsible use of the internet.  Oh, and make sure your IT group has the latest patches installed. Cloud computing does not generate viruses Not if you have up-to-date virus protection in place.  This certainly hasn't stopped people using email, where viruses are rife. Again this is a root issue in IT or training/implementation. if u train, retrain, & follow-up, it will b the same ppl who cont to mess up repeatedly. So take corrective action & remove individual privileges instead of corporate privileges. No more viruses than by using the internet.  Invest in AntiVirus software and EDUCATE your staff in basic internet security! Never have had one in my life from Social Media but have had many from people You might, unless 1) your IT department stays on top of the latest patches, which they should be doing anyway and 2) you don't communicate with your staff about how to avoid malware attacks. Also, if you insist on using PCs rather than Macs. That's a risk with all IT, and your IT department should block that at the firewall.  You don't block other IT, you still have email, and ERPs, and other software.  Why would you treat this any differently? Avoiding risk by banning activity is like barricading your house and never letting anyone in or out to protect yourself from crime, accidents, or illness. The keys to risk management are to implement sensible protections, educate employees, and provide the necessary guidance for them to leverage the tools in the safest way possible. Errr, no, thanks! I'm a Mac, I work with my iPhone, my iPod Touch and my iPad, sitting right next to my MacBook Pro. Viruses? No, not for this knowledge worker, I am afraid. But even if I were on a Windows platform, I trust the links and information / knowledge shared by my social networks and know exactly what to click and what not. That's why nurturing them has taken so much effort and energy over the course of the years. They are my social collaborative filter and they feed me with the best content available out there, and no viruses at all. Remember trust? I trust them to help me find the right information, just as much as they trust me to do my bit of sharing and feed them back with what they need. No stinking viruses over here. Thanks very much. Ok -- this one is sorta true. One of my least favorite sysadmin moments was the aftermath of the sasser virus. This virus was spread by clicking links in IMs -- usually from one of your (infected) buddies. The IM would say something like ""hey look at the pics you are in"". Worst memory: chatting with a QA friend, in his cube. I had *just* told him not to click on links in IM. He got an IM from another QA person, and clicked on the link as I said ""nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"".For the record, this is one reason companies started blocking IM. The virus was so nasty, we couldn't get servers on the network and get them updated faster than the virus would mutate and infect the new server. This impacted customer projects. Not good for the bottom lineI bet I'm not the only person who remembers this. I don't have a good idea how to counter-act this reason, because I think its a reasonable fear. Sorry everyone!! Yes we will. Not from social media per se, but sure, we'll get viruses. We already have some, in fact. The only way not to get them would be to detach all computer inputs, including disk drives, networks and keyboards. So you'd have computers. You couldn't do anything with them, but they'd be secure! Useless, but secure. 1 -- Your competition isn't using it, so why should you? Unless your competition is one of the thousands of start-ups coming to market, or incumbents like Cisco or IBM. Even dairy farmers use social media. You can be sure your markets are using social media to talk about your products and services. You might want to ask that question again.  Even the stodgiest companies have blogs, wikis and other pieces of the social media puzzle running.  And, once again, your customers are probably using it to talk with other customers. Actually an objection: ""We want to be on the cutting edge not the bleeding edge."" Well, the bleeding edge has already come & the cutting edge is now or passing. + there isn't anything that a well-written SM policy can't solve 2protect u legally. When did you last research your competition?  My competition use it.  And in any case, IF your competition doesn't use it, all the more reason for you to start -- it's a niche market for you Who cares whether they are or not, it's always better to be one step ahead If your decision about whether or not to engage in a business activity is based on whether or not your competition is doing it, then you have much bigger business problems than social media to address. Last I checked, one of the key tenets in business was to be the FIRST one to do something innovative, not the last. If your competition isn't using social media, you, in fact, have a golden opportunity to be first in class. I'd suggest that you seize it. Don't all business gurus tell you to do things your competition isn't doing to get ahead in business? Do you really have this as a reason for banning social media at work? Duh! Aren't you looking for every competitive advantage you can?  Why would you even think of not considering a possible advantage? The obvious responses to this are, ""How do you know if you're not on any social media platforms yourself?"" and ""Are your competitors the only stakeholders that matter? What about clients and prospects?"" The minute organizations start collecting the competitive intelligence to address these questions, they'll realize the power and potential value of social media. Oh, dear, think again, please; if you are worried about what your competition is doing, or not doing, you are asking the wrong question. It's not what your competition is doing, but more why are your customers already talking to your competition using all of these social tools and engaging on meaningful and trustworthy conversations? You should be asking yourself why are they talking about your competitors' products and not your own? You should be asking yourself why are they becoming the brand of your competitors' products so strongly that other customers and business partners are starting to pay attention to them and listening to them?That's the set of questions you should be asking about. Whether we like it or not, we are at a point in time where social networking tools are just so pervasive that there isn't any business out there which may not have been toying with the idea of improving the way they work, collaborate and share their knowledge with customers, as well as internally, using these social tools. You should not be an exception. You can't afford it at this point in time. If you have, you have already missed out a huge opportunity. I think this one just proves the whole video was a joke.And its easy to prove wrong. Do a Twitter search, do a search for a Facebook presence. Take screenshots, put them in a PowerPoint presentation. Point out how many people are following your competition, and perhaps point out some conversations the competition is having that could impact your bottom line. Send it to your stakeholders. Factually untrue, in our industry. There are social media leaders in our industry, and we aren't one of them. And now, some reasons IN FAVOUR To steal from Matt Ridley's ""Rational Optimist"" we learn from others in our population, as the population gets bigger, the better our choice of 'teachers'.  In my opinion, organisations should encourage social networking to enable employees to break down the walls of their organisation and to learn from the experts 'out there'. Intelligent use of social networking tools reduces the noise in my Inbox. Now we can use Yammer and Twitter for broadcasting 'chit chat' and LinkedIn for touching base, my inbox is for direct messages only.  Hurrah! Simply, the refusal to implement SM is based on a refusal/unwillingness to change/adapt or let go of control, fear of the  unknown, & a fear to see the true reality in an organization instead of the known unreal self-perception. Social Media lets me interact with others in the same area of expertise that I wouldn't otherwise have met.  I've gained so much knowledge and shared so many experiences I don't know how I could manage without it! I think the horse is definitively out of the barn -- I can't imagine there are all that many org or business leaders out there who haven't at least grudgingly accepted that we're well into a new ""here comes everybody"" age. (Unless you're, say, Halliburton, or maybe Yale's infamous Skull & Bones club -- e.g. an outfit that couldn't possibly gain anything but negative or unwanted attention from visibility on the social web.) It's been at least a year since I've had to lay out such rebuttals for anyone doing advocacy campaigning, and my chief client has social-media 100K+ Facebook fans, approx 200 staffers (!) blogging , and scores of staffers advancing their work via personal online identity, on twitter, FB, flickr, youtube & vimeo, and so on. Given the advantages of social media, and reducing cost of bandwidth, it might be a very worthwhile investment by the organization. Investing in bandwidth is probably as critical, if not more, than investing in higher-end machines and laptops. ",5,2
"The Maghreb's Modern Islamists Moha Ennaji 2012-02-16 FEZ – Just over a year ago , the Arab Spring sparked dramatic change throughout the Arab world . Popular movements have brought a range of avowedly Islamist political parties to power , replacing the largely secular former regimes . What that will mean for these countries , and for the region , is one of today's central geopolitical questions . In North Africa , two Islamist parties have come fully to power via democratic elections : al-Nahda ( Renaissance ) in Tunisia , where the Arab Spring began , and the Justice and Development Party ( PJD ) in Morocco , both of which now lead new coalition governments . Whereas a popular revolution produced regime change in Tunisia , Morocco underwent a peaceful transformation that left the monarchy in place . Last July , Moroccans voted overwhelmingly to approve a new constitution that shifts executive power from the king to the prime minister , who will now be fully responsible for the cabinet , the civil service , and the implementation of government policies . The king retains some prerogatives , such as the authority to select the prime minister ( from the parliament's majority party ) and the head of the army . Furthermore , like heads of state in other parliamentary systems , he has the right to appoint the government ministers and ambassadors , dissolve the parliament , and dismiss the cabinet . While the PJD's success was based on institution-building within a constitutional monarchy , al-Nahda has revolutionized the Tunisian system . But both parties won after running on a moderate platform of constitutionalism , separation of powers , civil liberties , and women's rights . This new political reality in the Maghreb will bring Europe – particularly France , the region's old colonial master – face-to-face with Islamist governments determined to promote a new type of relationship . But these governments have much work to do at home first . Currently , the Maghreb countries suffer from soaring unemployment , poverty , and high prices for basic commodities . In response , both al-Nahda and the PJD are emphasizing job creation , free trade , foreign investment , and a crackdown on the corruption that has plagued their countries' economies . These governments' first major test of economic stewardship will be how they treat the tourism industry . Although Western tourism is a critically important source of employment and foreign currency in both countries , some Muslims have criticized the industry for promoting alcohol and other relaxed social conventions that threaten Islamic values . So far , both al-Nahda and the PJD have taken a pragmatic stance . They recognize that , while their supporters may be devout Muslims , they also need to earn a living ; empty hotels and beaches would be economically disastrous . Thus , tourism professionals in both countries have received strong government assurances that business will continue as usual . Some European analysts predict that , over the longer term , greater stability will follow the political changes in the Maghreb , with perhaps more than a million unemployed Moroccan and Tunisian immigrants returning home if their countries' economies improve . That remains very much an open question . Islamist parties will now have enormous influence on economic policy , after decades of official separation of mosque and state . Islamic banking , for example , may soon be introduced , though some local and foreign investors argue that sharia regulations could drive away much-needed foreign investment . There are also concerns about inexperienced Islamist officials' ability to run finance ministries . But the region's Islamist parties appear to be conscious of these risks , and determined to mitigate them . They know that they need economic growth to curb unemployment and pay for social services , so they are working to bolster the private sector . In many cases , they are even advocating the kind of free-market policies that their secular predecessors favored . Those policies should include trade liberalization . Until now , less than 2 % of the Maghreb countries' foreign trade has remained within the region . If the region's new leaders can integrate their economies , a market of more than 75 million consumers would attract more foreign investment and trade with the rest of the world . Before an economically unified Maghreb can be realized , however , inter-state conflicts such as the Algerian-Moroccan dispute over the "" Western "" Sahara must be resolved . Otherwise , it will be difficult even to conceive a common future – without which the economic grievances that fueled the Maghreb's revolutions are likely to continue . Much like the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt , al-Nahda and the PJD will have to marginalize Islamic extremists in their movements , such as the Salafis , and adopt a pragmatic approach . To succeed economically , they will need Western support – and the West will not be eager to fund radical Islamist governments . As they negotiate the realities of modern economic life , the Maghreb's Islamist ruling parties are likely to lose some supporters . But , unless they are willing to break with the past , they will not succeed in the present .",4,1
"News & Events news Waiting list relief for Scottish patients Waiting times to see a specialist about hearing problems have been slashed in the Lothians after hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on new testing rooms . Deaf and hard of hearing patients now wait an average of around seven months to see an audiologist and have a hearing aid fitted - down from more than 18 months two years ago . Waiting times are set to fall even further with the appointment of a further six audiologists at the Ear , Nose and Throat ( ENT ) department at Lauriston Place . But the latest figures still fall three weeks short of the Scottish Executive's target of 26 weeks , which came into force in March this year . Nanette Milne , health spokeswoman for the Scottish Tories , said : "" It is very good news for people in Edinburgh and the Lothians that waiting times have already been reduced and that new audiologists have been appointed . "" I am not too concerned about Executive waiting times , as long as the needs of patients are being met and the fact that the wait has been cut by so much is fantastic . "" She added : "" I know waiting lists in audiology have meant people have been waiting a terribly long time to have hearing aids fitted . "" The new permanent staff will replace locums who are currently carrying out the work , saving NHS Lothian £ 180,000 a year . Two have already started work , and the others are set to begin soon . Some of them will later be moved to the audiology department at St John's Hospital , Livingston . In February , the health authority spent £ 470,000 installing four new sound-proofed rooms to measure hearing ability at Lauriston Place . An extra 240 people a week are seen by audiologists since the booths were installed - a 60 per cent rise since February . But patients are still having to wait an average of 29 weeks from being referred by their GP to having a hearing aid fitted . Mark Hamilton , manager of the ENT department at Lauriston Place , said : "" These additions to the audiology department are great news for patients . We have just revised our waiting list timetables which means people will now be getting access to treatment sooner . "" Over the next few months we are also expecting a big increase in the number of patients attending our department . "" Hearing problems are a major disadvantage to a lot of people and our patients can rest assured that NHS Lothian is always striving to deliver high quality health services . "" A Scottish Executive spokeswoman said : "" We are committed to a programme of modernisation of audiology services in Scotland , and to making available digital hearing aids where there is a clinical need . All boards can now fit digital hearing aids if appropriate . "" A target of 26 weeks' waiting time from referral to fitting is being achieved by some , but not all , boards as the starting point for modernisation varied from board to board . "" Around £ 17 million has been made available to NHS boards over 2003-07 to modernise audiology services . I had just had enough so I decided to go privately Long waiting lists have forced some patients to have hearing aids fitted privately . Frank Cochrane , 73 , of Trinity , waited to see an NHS Lothian audiologist for nearly two years after being referred by his GP . He said : "" My hearing started to go very gradually more than three years ago . When I first went to see my GP , it had gone only a little bit , but by the time I got to the Ear , Nose and Throat , it was really quite bad . "" I have had terrible problems waiting to see someone at the NHS . Once I eventually did see someone at the hospital , they told me I would face another wait to have a hearing aid fitted . I had just had enough , so I decided to go privately . "" Mr Cochrane , who had one foot amputated earlier this year , contacted a private firm who came to his home to carry out tests and fit two hearing aids . He added : "" When I was in hospital having my foot amputated , I dropped my hearing aid and broke it . I decided to see if there was any way I could get it repaired on the NHS , but I was told I would have to join the bottom of the list again .

"Held at the Palais des Nations , Geneva , on Thursday , 30 August 2007 , at 10.15 a . m . President : Mr. Faysal KHABBAZ HAMOUI ( Syrian Arab Republic ) The PRESIDENT ( spoke in Arabic ) : I declare open the 1080th plenary meeting of the Conference on Disarmament . At the outset , I should like to extend a warm welcome on behalf of the Conference on Disarmament to the participants in the United Nations Programme of Fellowships on Disarmament who are observing the proceedings of this plenary . I am quite sure they will benefit from their participation in this forum , especially from the presentations that will be made to them on the various aspects of the work of the Conference . On behalf of the Conference on Disarmament and on my own behalf , I should like to bid farewell to Ambassador Elisabeth Bonnier , our distinguished colleague from Sweden , who will be leaving Geneva soon to take up other important duties , having brought with her a wealth of experience gained within the Swedish Foreign Ministry and abroad , including a first round from 1983 to 1988 in the Conference on Disarmament and also as a member of the Secretary-General's Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters . Ambassador Elisabeth Bonnier joined us in 2003 as the Permanent Representative of Sweden to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva . As a representative of a country with a pre-eminent focus on multilateral disarmament and non-proliferation , she has always been actively and insistently involved in the effort to break the deadlock in this body and to resume the substantive work . I should like to express my particular gratitude to her for her extensive efforts to end the stalemate in this body as one of the six Presidents of this year's session . On behalf of the Conference and on my own behalf , I would like to convey to Ambassador Bonnier every wish for success and happiness . While we are sad to see Ambassador Bonnier leave Geneva , I am happy to extend a cordial welcome to our new colleague from Canada , Ambassador Marius Grinius . On behalf of the Conference on Disarmament and on my own behalf , I would like to assure Ambassador Grinius of our readiness to provide him with every kind of assistance and support for his work in Geneva . Before turning to the speakers for today , I would like to introduce the Presidential report on the third part of the 2007 session . I closely followed the consultations that the former President of the Conference on Disarmament , Ambassador Jürg Streuli , held on the Presidential proposal . I also followed the work of the six Presidents on the same matter . A series of meetings were held with a large number of Ambassadors of member States . Allow me to summarize the results of these activities as set forth in the Presidential report on part 3 of the 2007 session , which was distributed to you today by the secretariat . My evaluation of the results consists of three points . The first point is that a wide range of delegations expressed their support for the Presidential proposal based on the three annexed documents , L. 1 CRP . 5 and CRP . 6 . Although some delegations expressed reservations about certain elements of the proposal , they said that they were willing to join the consensus on the proposal . Others expressed the view that more work and consultations were needed to reach a consensus . The second point is that the Conference on Disarmament has achieved substantial progress by conducting important thematic debates on all agenda items . However , it has not yet been able to reach a consensus on a programme of work . As to the third point , momentum has been created to end the long-standing impasse at the Conference on Disarmament and efforts to reach an agreement must be continued . This is the summary of the three points contained in the Presidential report on part 3 of the 2007 session . I should now like to open the floor to any delegations that wish to make a statement at today's meeting . I have no speakers on my list . Does any delegation wish to take the floor ? The Ambassador of Sweden . You have the floor . Ms. BORSIIN BONNIER ( Sweden ) : Mr. President , I thank you very much , and initially , let me warmly welcome you on the assumption of the Chair of this august body . Although I will be leaving Geneva , I assure you that my delegation will continue to do its utmost to support you in the important tasks ahead . I also thank you warmly for your initial kind remarks on my person . This is my last plenary meeting , and therefore , in line with the traditions of the CD , I will conclude with a few personal remarks . Mr. President , for altogether nine years , as you noted , I have entered this Council chamber with hope and with expectations . I have seen this room being the anchor of sincere multilateral work to bring about a more secure world . At times the Conference on Disarmament has even been the centre of gravity for the international community in Geneva . I have seen it vibrating with energy , bold ideas , creative intellect focused on problem-solving and a determination to make a difference and to turn the tide . Important pieces of international law have been negotiated here ; compliance with vital norms has been discussed and defended with vigour and conviction . But I have also seen the opposite : an anaemic stalemate with delegations resorting to recitals of ceremonious mantras , covering up the traces of their own passivity with useless finger-pointing and blame games , hiding behind the commas of the rules of procedure and shamelessly abusing the consensus rule to abort any attempt to seriously tackle difficult or sensitive issues - in effect taking the whole multilateral approach to disarmament and arms control hostage to their own particular perceptions , preferences or dictates . But still , I continue to enter this room with hope and expectations . The certainties of yesterday are gone . Security perceptions , threats and challenges are in a state of flux . New dangers are emerging , adding to the burden of the old ones . But the debate of old versus new threats is a meaningless one . Unless we try to face both , neither will be dealt with . In the nuclear field we see more brinkmanship than statesmanship . Globalization works to make complex weapon technologies widely available . Military expenses have risen to well beyond a trillion United States dollars . The illusion of an impenetrable defence is taking new forms . Our space assets with their huge scientific and economic potentials are not secure . Cyber-wars are no longer just science fiction , but can disrupt our societies on a massive scale . The overall balance between global security problems solved and those unsolved is , I believe , negative . The uncertainties of tomorrow are , however - and let us not forget - the opportunities of today . Reluctantly or enthusiastically we will have to accept that global problems in a time of galloping globalization can not be solved unilaterally , bilaterally or even in small circles of like-minded nations . Global security must be built globally . Effective multilateralism is both necessary and possible . It means that the legitimate security concerns of all States must be acknowledged . It means seizing opportunities when they arise . It means reconsidering positions that yield no results . And it means a readiness to give and take . Global security can never be a zero-sum game . Just as the rule of law is a fundamental cornerstone in domestic affairs , so it must also be in international affairs . Without it we will be on the slippery slope towards anarchy and the use of force . Laws are sometimes broken , but this does not make them less essential . Quite the opposite . It reinforces the need to uphold and strengthen them . This is particularly important in the area of international security relations . But there are serious lacunae , both as regards the laws themselves and our ability to see them complied with . We do have a forum where we can approach all these difficult realities together . It is called the Conference on Disarmament . Rejecting the use of the CD is irresponsible . Those blocking the potentials of this body should understand that they are inflicting real damage not only to the security of others , to our common security , but in the long run also to their own . Since the beginning of this year I have had the privilege of working as one of the P-6 . This Presidential sextet has jointly and consistently tried to put the CD back to work , tried to move us from talk shop to workshop , tried to make us take on the challenges of our time . And by now , most delegations stand ready to try . We have come very close to begin a beginning . As I am now leaving , I am sorry not to be with you when you cross the last bridge . Because cross it you will . There is no other way . Now there remains for me only to express my many and sincere thanks : to the Secretary-General for his support , wisdom and friendship , always at our side . To my fellow P-6 colleagues and our coordinators for their remarkable team spirit and seriousness of purpose . To my colleagues , the CD Ambassadors and their delegations for their many expressions of support and friendship . To everyone in the secretariat who keeps toiling for us in good spirits and solidarity . To the interpreters who try to make sense of our sometimes incomprehensible utterings in all languages . And to the representatives of civil society who with great patience and frustration stay engaged . Thank you all . When I leave this Council chamber today I will do so as I have always entered it - with hope and expectations . The PRESIDENT ( spoke in Arabic ) : I thank the Ambassador of Sweden for her kind wishes addressed to the Conference , and we in turn wish her every success . The delegation of France has asked for the floor . You have the floor , Madam . Ms. RAMIS-PLUM ( France ) ( spoke in French ) : I simply wished to raise a point of a technical or even presentational nature in the draft decision which is attached to the report on the third part of our session . I think there is simply a small presentational matter which , in the opinion of my delegation , needs to be rectified . The body of decision L. 1 has been separated presentationally from the complementary Presidential statement . We consider that , in the original version of this document these two elements which from a whole were together and should remain together , as they were in the text of decision L. 1 which has been distributed until now . The PRESIDENT ( spoke in Arabic ) : I thank the representative of France . We shall discuss this matter with the secretariat . Does any delegation wish to make a statement ? I do not see any . Concerning next week's work , the secretariat , later this afternoon , will place the draft report on the 2007 session in the members' pigeonholes . For ease of access , the secretariat will also send out an electronic copy , in PDF format , to the regional coordinators , who can then distribute the document to the members of their respective groups . Next week , i . e . on Tuesday 4 September 2007 , I will proceed with the first reading . As usual , this will be done at an informal meeting right after the formal plenary , which will start at 10 a . m . in this room . Before bringing this morning's work to a close I wish to make some comments on the final report . First , I should like to thank my colleagues the Ambassadors of the G-6 for their strong support for this draft report . I also wish to thank the secretariat for its outstanding efforts which helped us to complete this draft on time for it to be translated into all the United Nations official languages . As I have already said , the G-6 chairpersons helped us to prepare this report and supported it once it had been completed . The report reflects the consensus in the group . We all hope that this consensus will lead to a consensus within the Conference , especially given that the G-6 represents a wide cross section of the Conference membership . We look forward to your cooperation in adopting this report , which we endeavoured to ensure would contain an objective and impartial account of the proceedings at this year's Conference . We did our utmost to take account of the concerns of all the members , which was not an easy task . The President hopes that when the draft text is discussed next Tuesday , it will enjoy the support of you all , that you will take account of these comments , and show the necessary flexibility for its adoption . Thank you for your understanding . Before closing the meeting , does any delegation wish to take the floor ? I see none . I declare this meeting adjourned . The meeting rose at 10.45 a . m . ( Ms. Borsiin Bonnier , Sweden ) ( The President )",5,3

Around 18.9% of people belong to 0-14 year's age group. The 65 and above age group constitutes 13.6 % of the total population. The average age of the population in 2010 was 36.9 years. The median age of the country increased by 40.8% from the previous two decades. The median age from the year 2009 and 2010 remains stable at 36.8 years. From 2005 to 2010, the infant mortality rate was recorded as 4.5 per 1,000 live births. The average life expectancy for men is 79.1 years and for women is 83.8 years. The country is ranked 53 rd on the Human Poverty Index with a score of 28.1. The Human Poverty index focuses on the proportion of people below certain threshold levels in each of the dimensions of the human development index - living a long and healthy life, having access to education, and a decent standard of living. The country ranks 56 th out of 182 countries on the Human Development index 2010 conducted by the United Nations. The HDI provides a composite measure  of three dimensions of human development: living a long and healthy life (measured by life expectancy), being educated (measured by adult literacy and gross enrolment in education). The education system in Australia has consistently improved over the past few years. The education system includes Primary education, Secondary education (Secondary Schools / High Schools), Tertiary education in Universities and / or TAFE [Technical and Further Education] Colleges). In Australia, the schooling system starts from kindergarten or preparatory year followed by 12 years of primary and secondary school. In secondary school, the students can appear for Government endorsed certificates, recognized by all Australian universities and vocational education and training institutions. In the states and territories, it is the primary responsibility for state Government schools to collect the funds. In addition, they also provide assistance to non-Government schools. The non-Government schools have religious affiliation. The two-thirds of non-Government school students are in Catholic schools. The healthcare system in Australia includes the Government, private and medical practitioners. The Government provides three schemes i.e., Medicare, Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme and 30% health insurance rebate. In 2008, the Government expenditure on healthcare was 9.1% of GDP. ",1,4

If we finish 7th or 8th this season, we have to stick with him, there's no point in changing managers every season for not getting us into the top four. He cant really afford to finish outside the top 10, but a season to get himself comfortable wouldn't be the worst thing. If we show no improvement for 2 or 3 years, then his position will need to be reviewed, but we must remain patient if we finish 7th or 8th this time round. The main issue regarding this question is: How many years of mediocrity can we afford before the value of the brand LFC comes crashing down? History is one thing, but if it begins to look as though we are permanently out of CL football we will quickly lose much of our international support and brand value. I think Rodgers can survive 1 season of mid-table finish, but ONLY if there is real exciting progress from a few of our youngsters and thus the outlook for serious improvement the next season. A mediocre start into his second season would necessitate major changes by January 2014 to keep hope and brand value alive. AIMO. Totally. But we have to trust at least one manager and give him the time needed to put things right. I agree that we need to trust a manager. But the manager needs to earn that trust as well. I'm assuming here, that Rafa was sacked because he underachieved in the latter part of his time with us. It is debatable as to whether he would have been able to pull the team back together, but there were many factors that led to him leaving, the primary one being our league position. I don't intend to go further than that. Roy, just never fit in with the club and its ethos, in my opinion. Kenny, if he had pulled the team round in 2012, would still be here I reckon. The problem is that you require a team to respond to the manager. But if a team starts to go wayward, and it shows no signs of abating, then action is taken. I think that is what our last three manager sackings were primarily based on. A manager should be given time, but they also need to show that they earned it or that there are signs it could work out. Obviously, the scenarios I placed above are points of contention, but generally, that's where I think it stands, right or wrong. Thought I would ask this question - Would you put up with finishing around seventh or eighth for the next two or three seasons, and be patient with BR? The way it's looking, this is going to be a massive rebuilding job Rodgers has got to do, and it could take years to put right We may not have a choice but to put up with a few seasons trying to get things right on the pitch , but it's no good in keeping changing the manager every 18 months I feel we are going to have to put up with quite a few bumps on the road in the coming seasons. Give Rodgers our full backing & time to get things right! People need to realice the task ahead. We are not just going to do a few ajustments and then its fine. We need a massive rebuilding of the squad and of the way we have been playing. Unlike Chelski and MC we can't buy instant succes. So it will take hard work and brave decisions. We need to clearout all the mistake of the past, and this will probably mean that we must take a step back before we can move forward. I agree that we need to trust a manager. But the manager needs to earn that trust as well. I'm assuming here, that Rafa was sacked because he underachieved in the latter part of his time with us.

Obviously, the scenarios I placed above are points of contention, but generally, that's where I think it stands, right or wrong. Totally agree that trust needs to be earned and so far BR has done more to make me not trust him than believe in him. One comment I would make regarding Rafa is that players had openly come out and stated that they wanted Rafa back so why he wasn't rehired for me was one of many grave errors made by FSG. ",0,0
"Ch-ch-changes - Part Five Giles saw Buffy grab Spike's lapels , and he did n't bother to repress a groan . "" Oh , you git . You have n't told her ? "" "" Told me that you have a , a -- "" she began . "" -- Love , just hang on . "" Then Spike shot him a look as narrow-eyed and vicious as any in the Big Bad's pre-conscience arsenal . "" Giles . Go , and take Anya with you . "" Leaning on Anya's supporting arm , he got to his feet . Much as he enjoyed being this close to her , he was damn tired of the tottering-old-man moves . Also , his ribs stung , even though he knew Spike had tried not to break anything when saving his life . All in all , it was n't the post-crisis image he had hoped to project , which lent an edge to his voice : "" Keys then , mate . "" "" What ? "" "" Keys . I 'm not bloody walking . Give me the car keys . "" Spike jerked away from Buffy's pinioning arms , dug in his pocket , then hurled them hard , straight and over-arm . Should have guessed the little twerp was a fast bowler , Giles thought . Not being a fool , he did n't attempt a catch but let the keys fall in the dust behind him . "" I 'll get them for you , Rupert . "" Anya bent down , a pleasing angle , and retrieved them . "" Although I could always just have teleported -- "" "" No ! "" He had to take a breath , lower his voice . "" No , dear , I 'd prefer to drive . "" And he crooked his arm for her . "" Would you care to accompany me ? "" She looked at him for a second , then inclined her head and accepted his escort to the DeSoto . *** When he heard the car pull away , Spike turned away from Buffy . There lay the ruins of what once had been Sunnydale High , deceptively picturesque in the moonlight . They had had their first real confrontation in those halls . He could almost hear the echoes in the still night : "" As a personal favour from me to you , I promise I 'll make it quick . It wo n't hurt a bit . "" And her soft-voiced "" No , Spike . It 's gonna hurt a lot . "" He had had no idea how much , he thought . He really had n't . Then he was spun around hard , and Buffy grabbed the coat again . "" Is it true ? What Giles said ? You have a soul now . "" "" Yes , although I 'd prefer you not to call it -- "" She pushed him away with Slayer-strength , and he stumbled back several feet . "" What the bloody hell was that for ? "" "" For you being you , stupid idiot ! What did you do ? What were you thinking ? To go off ... to make me ... let me ... oh God , I ca n't breathe -- "" and she fell to her knees , sobbing . He cursed under his breath , then dropped down beside her . "" Oh , love . Please . Please do n't . "" She shook with the force of her tears , her body almost coming apart , and he could n't bear it . Tentatively he put his arms around her -- she at once tried to crawl into his lap , but he was n't situated quite right . The two of them struggled , almost toppling over , but he used his strength to balance and find a place for her . And then he rocked her , murmuring "" Darling , darling "" into her hair as she let out months of accumulated pain in almost animal wails . He wrapped his hands around hers and held on . *** Giles wrapped his hands tightly around the old steering wheel . Anya was sitting quietly in the passenger seat , looking out the cracks of the painted windshield , and he could n't stop turning his head to make sure she was still there , still next to him . "" Giles , why do you keep looking at me ? "" Well , it is Anya , he thought , he should expect the honest question . He would have to be honest in return , if he could just clear his throat of all the words ( lies , compliments , lines , entreaties ) choking him . "" Dear , I 'm happy that you 're here . And I 'm afraid you 'll leave . "" She did n't say anything . He sighed , then realized something . He had been driving for a bit , not actually heading in a specific direction , but apparently Ripper had been sending coded messages to his brain . They had reached his hotel . He pulled into the parking lot , found a place , and turned off the car . Yet Anya said nothing . This was n't like her at all . "" Would you , er , like to come in for a drink ? Celebrate teamwork , preventing the collapse of dimensions , another success ? I 'm not suggesting my room , but the hotel bar has a rather nice selection of -- "" Her eyes wide and dark , she leaned across and put her finger on his lips . Well , then . He kissed the finger . And she lunged at him . *** Buffy did n't cry as long as he 'd expected . The tearing sobs soon subsided into hiccuping breaths , and now she sat quietly , cradled in his lap , her small hands surrounded by his . But of course that would n't last either . He started counting in his head : one , two , three , four -- And she pushed up and off , one boot digging into his shin as she moved . She was such a wounded creature , he thought , so far from the happy girl he 'd first seen twirling , hands in the air , at the Bronze . But she was strong . And it was the strong Buffy who turned to face him now . She had dashed tears away , but the tracks were still visible in the moonlight . Her face was set , but not cold -- a gain , a definite gain , he thought . Then she said something he had n't anticipated : "" Who did you kill ? "" Fabulous . A trick question . "" What ? Pet , I did n't keep a list or anything . Well other than -- "" And for the first time in his long unlife he managed to bite back , literally , the completely stupid comment "" of Slayers "" which was coming next . He could taste the blood on his tongue . "" No. No , Spike . I mean , who did you kill so that you got cursed with a soul . "" Bloody buggering hell . Bloody bollocks of a bog-trotting son of a bitch , the Poof struck again . Fired by a blast of sudden crackling rage , Spike leapt to his feet and roared , "" No one ! Not in a long time , oh , DAMN it ! "" He stalked forward . "" See , this is why I did n't tell you . Besides that we got busy and I forgot . You had to bring him into it , did n't you ? ' S never about Spike , no , it 's all about HIM . "" He whirled , paced away from her so that he would n't unleash fist or fangs . He should have guessed , why had n't he guessed . She spun him around again , and he snarled . She did n't run . Got closer , hands on the duster , fingernails digging in . "" Then how the hell did you get a soul , if not cursed ? Wal-Mart ? Buy-and-sell-souls-dot-com ? ' Cause I 'm really eager to know . "" "" Oh are you ? Could n't tell from over here . Been back two sodding days , have n't heard much in the way of inquiry about where I 've been or what I 've been doing . Why the bloody hell would I bother to tell you anything ? "" "" I saved you this morning ! And I told you not to dust ! "" "" Yeah , ' cause you wanted to kill me yourself . God , Buffy . "" And the anger burned out as quickly as it had come . He put his hands over hers , holding her to him . This was going to be worse than the quest itself . "" Right then . After I hurt you so badly ... before , you know ... I realized I could n't stay the way I was . Torn up . So I heard about this spirit-caller half a world away , and I decided I 'd see what there was to see . Find out if there was something else I could do or be . "" Her eyes were locked on him . He could n't read them , though , and he swallowed hard . "" Managed to get to the shaman , and he sent me inside myself . I wo n't tell you what I saw or did , but end result , a conscience and no chip . "" He managed a short , pain-filled laugh . "" We 're not calling it a soul for the very reason you just demonstrated . I 'm not Peaches , nor was meant to be . "" She looked at him for a long moment . Her fingers intertwined with his , pressed briefly , then pulled away . "" Oh , Spike . You might not be Angel . But you keep changing on me . "" She brushed a butterfly kiss on his lips , then she walked away from him . He stood there in the moonlight . Yeah , he had had no idea how much it was going to hurt . *** "" Damn it , that hurt ! "" Giles snapped , briefly coming out of his fog of lust . Almost stretched out in the front seat of the DeSoto , lips and hands fully engaged on top of the sweet-smelling and quite delightfully aggressive ( if still unfortunately clothed ) Anya , was a location next door to paradise . If only he did n't keep hitting the steering column whenever he moved . "" What ? Wait . Wait . Giles , get off . "" And Anya pushed him back into the steering column , hitting right on the fresh bruise . Bloody buggery hell . Swallowing a more inventive stream of curses and firmly shoving Ripper ( now growling in frustration ) back into the mental box where he usually lived , Giles managed to scramble back to his side of the car . Breathe in and breathe out , old man . Think of tweed . Think of Travers . Anya took her own series of deep calming breaths , settling back into the passenger seat . The two sat there a moment , separate , staring into black glass . Then Giles managed , his voice almost normal , "" Anya ? You all right ? "" "" I think so . "" His hand went towards hers , but she moved a bit further away from him . "" Giles , would you say my name ? "" "" Darling Anya . "" Her brown eyes did n't waver from his . Oh , right . "" Anyanka . "" Those eyes filled with tears . "" You do n't want to be with Anyanka , do you ? Not really . "" Did he want to love a demon ? He 'd never imagined , even in his chaos-worshiping days , such a question posed to him . But he needed to answer it honestly . He took a moment to organize his thoughts , then claimed her hand . "" I want to be with you . The vengeance part deeply troubles me , I admit ; the idea of you hurting people throughout dimensions , well ... But strangely , er , I do n't actually mind the demon part . "" He risked a small grin . "" At least when you 're Anyanka , I 'm the younger man . "" "" Are you worried about age ? Because from what I can tell , you 're far more skilled than , say , Xander , which -- "" "" Darling , stop right there . Please , no comparisons . Ever . "" She squeezed his hand . "" But you 're better so far . "" He could n't repress a laugh , and she smiled at him . Then her expression shifted , back to that thinking-hard face he 'd seen a thousand times , over invoices or a question of demon history or that stock-market website she favoured , and his heart melted . Then she turned to him . "" I have to go right now . I have something to do . But I 'll be back soon . "" She released his hand , then disapparated . He stared at the empty space beside him . God , he needed a drink . Of his private stock . *** Spike's right hand reached for his glass , and he took a swallow of extremely good brandy . As golden as the lamplight in which he sat , it warmed him a bit . Then he bent to his task again , his left hand moving across the page of his notebook . The bell over the door rang , and he looked up to see Giles . "" What are you doing in the Magic Box , Spike ? And how did you get in ? "" "" Did n't want to go home . Came through the basement . "" He returned to his notebook . Giles walked over to the table and picked up the bottle of brandy . Spike did n't need to look up to know that Rupert's eyebrows were up around his ( receding ) hairline : poor Watcher had n't realized Spike had found the good stuff months ago . Then Giles fetched another glass , came back to the table , and sat . He poured his own , then took a sip . Spike finished the sentence he was writing , then drank again . Giles scrutinized him , but at least it was n't the Ripper stare he 'd used to terrorize Xander . He took another drink . Giles mirrored his action , then put his glass on the table . "" So what happened with you and Buffy after Anya and I left ? "" "" Bollocksed everything up . And you ? "" "" Almost got shagged . "" The two burst into shared laughter , which dwindled into chuckles , until the Magic Box was silent . Giles spoke again . "" What are you writing ? "" Spike pushed the notebook across the table . Giles adjusted his glasses and read through the page , then flipped back a page or two more . "" This is very good . Very clear , detailed . "" "" I started keeping records on her fights after you left . Well , as many as I knew about . Got the rest back at the crypt . "" "" The Watcher's Council would be interested in these . "" Spike snorted . Yeah , he was sure the Council of Wankers would just love a vampire's field reports . "" I appreciate the praise , Rupes . But I think they 'd prefer an actual Watcher's comments , yeah ? And now that you 're back -- "" "" Sunnydale 's not my home any more . "" The words fell into a hush . Spike thought Giles had rather surprised himself with them . "" I 'm still connected here , still tied . I wo n't cut myself off again , as I did this past year . But I do n't live here . "" "" Y ' know , I felt like that in London . "" Giles raised his eyebrows , and Spike shrugged . "" I love the old girl , I really do . Have a favourite spot , in fact : nighttime , obviously , on the terrace of Somerset House , overlooking the river . The weight of the stone behind me , the sound of traffic and water below , the lights on the South Bank opposite . Time passes sweetly there . "" He picked up his glass again , swirled the brandy around the bowl . Giles did the same , meditatively . "" But Sunnyhell is where my heart is . "" The bell of the door jangled again , and Buffy came in . Spike nodded across the table . "" As you see . "" Giles drained his glass , then stood . "" I 've still got the car , Spike . "" He walked to the door , then gave Buffy a hug . She clung to him for a moment , then they let each other go . He smiled down at her . "" Do n't let Spike bollocks it up again . And do n't you either , my dear . "" And he left them alone . Spike was thankful he did n't have to breathe , because he was n't sure he could . Buffy hesitated , her eyes on the floor , then she came to him . Not all the way , though ; she hovered just out of reach . "" You were n't at the crypt . "" "" No. "" "" I was afraid you were gone . "" "" Again , no . Just came back , did n't I. "" She nodded . And , with a sudden swirl of air , she sat on his lap . He crushed his lips to her hair -- God , he loved her hair -- and waited . She wound her fingers through his , and said with a rush , "" The thing I forgot tonight ? When you told me ? "" He tightened his grip . "" Change is n't always a bad thing . "" And her mouth was on his . *** Giles stood in the shadows of the alley besides the DeSoto , jingling his keys . Good to know that someone would be happy tonight , even if once again it would n't be Rupert Giles . He was bloody tired of being left out , but there it was . He wished it was n't . "" Rupert . "" He turned to see Anya standing in the moonlight , just outside the alley . She took one step toward him , then another . "" I had to see D ' Hoffryn . Because I 'm not sure I want to be human again , what with all the pain and confusion and the dying , but I know I want to be with you . So I had to check with D ' Hoffryn , to see if I could quit but not actually quit , if you see what I mean -- "" He did n't remember moving , but he was there and she was in his arms . He fisted one hand in her hair , thrust a knee between her thighs , kissed her as deeply as he had dreamed about in those long and lonely months . Then he swung her around , maneuvered her . And it was Ripper's voice that came out of his mouth : "" We 'll bloody talk about this later . "" "" Oh , Rupie , "" she moaned as he lowered her to the bonnet of the car . *** For the moment as giddy as the girl she had been when he first met her , Buffy swung Spike's hand . He closed the Magic Box door behind them , and she pulled him into the moonlight . "" I guess I have n't been the brightest star tonight in the now-safely-Toller-free sky , have I. "" "" You get no argument from me . "" She thwapped him on the shoulder , then snuggled close as they started to walk . "" I do have to check on Dawnie and Willow , but then -- "" she smiled at him -- "" let 's see if we can manage not to break any furniture . "" His lips trailed down her neck and further , then she pushed his head away and put a finger to his open mouth . "" Do you hear something ? "" From the alley opposite came the sound of a muffled thud , thud against metal , then mingled , synchronized gasps . "" No , I do n't hear a damned thing . Walk with me , love , walk with me . "" She rolled her eyes but followed as he pulled her more quickly down the street . He smiled at her , thinking , Tosser 's going to pay if he makes any dents .",8,8
"We 're 25 , 26 years after the advent of the Macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface , and in computation in general . It fundamentally changed the way that people thought about computation , thought about computers , how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them . It was such a radical change , in fact , that the early Macintosh development team in ' 82 , ' 83 , ' 84 , had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up . Now , this is an interesting little message , and it 's a lesson that has since , I think , been forgotten or lost or something . And that is , namely , that the OS is the interface . The interface is the OS . It 's like the land and the king ( i . e . Arthur ) they 're inseparable , they are one . And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter . It was n ' t just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines . There were no graphics routines . There were no mouse drivers . So it was a necessity . But in the quarter century since then , we 've seen all of the fundamental supporting technologies go berserk . So memory capacity and disk capacity have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million . Same thing for processor speeds . Networks , we did n't have networks at all at the time of the Macintosh's introduction . And that has become the single most salient aspect of how we live with computers . And , of course , graphics : today $ 84 . 97 at Best Buy buys you more graphics power than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago . So we 've got that incredible ramp-up . Then , on the side , we 've got the Web and , increasingly , the cloud , which is fantastic , but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental -- kind of a distraction . So we 've forgotten to invent new interfaces . Certainly we 've seen , in recent years , a lot of change in the regard . And people are starting to wake up about that . So what happens next ? Where do we go from there ? The problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word , "" space "" or a single , simple phrase , "" real world geometry . "" Computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hideously insensate when it comes to space . They do n't understand real world space . It 's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well . They also do n't understand time , but that 's a matter for a separate talk . So what happens if you start to explain space to them ? One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room . The Luminous Room is a system in which it 's considered that input and output spaces are co-located . That 's a strangely simple , and yet unexplored idea , right ? When you use a mouse , your hand is down here on the mouse pad . It 's not even on the same plane as what you 're talking about : the pixels are up on the display . So here was a room in which all the walls , floors , ceilings , pets , potted plants , whatever was in there , were capable , not only , of display , but of sensing as well . And that means input and output are in the same space enabling stuff like this . That 's a digital storage in a physical container . The contract is the same as with real word objects in real world containers . Has to come back out , whatever you put in . This little design experiment that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well . If you presented it with a chess board , it tried to figure out what you might mean by that . And if there was nothing for them to do , the chess pieces eventually got bored and hopped away . The academics who were overseeing this work thought that was too frivolous , so we then built deadly serious applications like this optics prototyping workbench in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box becomes a laser . The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects , and the system projects down the laser beam path . So you 've got an interface that has no interface . You operate the world as you operate the real world , which is to say , with your hands . Similarly , a digital wind tunnel with digital wind flowing from right to left . Not that remarkable in a sense ; we did n't invent the mathematics . But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display , it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object , a real world object on it . Here , the real world merges with the simulation . And finally , to pull out all the stops , this is a system called Urp , for urban planners , in which we give architects and urban planners back the models that we confiscated when we insisted that they use CAD systems . And we make the machine meet them half way . Urp projects down digital shadows , as you see here . And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock , then you can control the sun's position in the sky . That 's 8 : 00 AM shadows . They get a little shorter at 9 : 00 AM . There you are , swinging the sun around . Short shadows at noon and so forth . And we built up a series of tools like this . There are inter-shadowing studies that children can operate , even though they do n't know anything about urban planning , to move a building , you simply reach out your hand and you move the building . A material wand makes the building into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions . Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways ? A zoning tool connects distant structures , a building and a roadway . Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission ? and so forth . Now , if these ideas seem familiar or perhaps even a little dated , that 's great ; they should seem familiar . This work is 15 years old . This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab under the incredible direction of Prof. Hiroshi Ishii , director of the Tangible Media Group . And it was that work that was seen by Alex McDowell , one of the world's legendary production designers . Alex was preparing a little , sort of obscure , indie , arthouse film called "" Minority Report "" for Steven Spielberg , and invited us to come out from MIT and design the interfaces that would appear in that film . And the great thing about it was that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude , the idea that the putative 2054 that we were painting in the film be believable , that he allowed us to take on that design work as if it were an R & D effort . And the result is sort of gratifyingly perpetual . People still reference those sequences in "" Minority Report "" when they talk about new UI design . So this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the Spatial Operating Environment , we call it . So here we have a bunch of stuff , some images . And , using a hand , we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom , six degrees of navigational control . And it 's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye . And you can come back out through the scary orangutan . And that 's all well and good . Let's do something a little more difficult . Here , we have a whole bunch of disparate images . We can fly around them . So navigation is a fundamental issue . You have to be able to navigate in 3D . Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place is inherently spatial . And the part that is n't spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it . Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways . So we can throw it out like that . Let 's reset it . We can organize it this way . And , of course , it 's not just about navigation , but about manipulation as well . So if we do n't like something , or we 're intensely curious about Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications , we can pull them out like that . And then if it 's time for analysis , we can pull back a little bit and ask for a different distribution . Let 's just come down a bit and fly around . So that 's a different way to look at stuff . If you 're of a more analytical nature then you might want , actually , to look at this as a color histogram . So now we 've got the stuff color-sorted , angle maps onto color . And now , if we want to select things , 3D , space , the idea that we 're tracking hands in real space becomes really important because we can reach in , not in 2D , not in fake 2D , but in actual 3D . Here are some selection planes . And we 'll perform this Boolean operation because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass . So , from there to the world of real work . Here 's a logistics system , a small piece of one that we 're currently building . There 're a lot of elements . And one thing that 's very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three-dimensional and geospatial information . So here 's a familiar place . And we 'll bring this back here for a second . Maybe select a little bit of that . And bring out this graph . And we should , now , be able to fly in here and have a closer look . These are logistics elements that are scattered across the United States . One thing that three-dimensional interactions and the general idea of imbuing computation with space affords you is a final destruction of that unfortunate one to one pairing between human beings and computers . That 's the old way ; that 's the old mantra , one machine , one human , one mouse , one screen . Well , that does n ' t really cut it anymore . In the real world , we have people who collaborate ; we have people who have to work together . And we have many different displays . And we might want to look at these various images . We might want to ask for some help . The author of this new pointing device is sitting over there , so I can pull it from here to there . These are unrelated machines , right ? So the computation is space soluble and network soluble . So I 'm going to leave that over there because I have a question for Paul . Paul is the designer of the wand , and maybe its easiest for him to come over here and tell me in person what 's going on . So let me get some of these out of the way . Let 's pull this apart : I 'll go ahead and explode it . Kevin , can you help ? Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board . Mind you , it 's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise , but we do it in the lab all the time . All right . So collaborative work , whether it 's immediately co-located or distant and distinct , is always important . And again , that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space . And finally , I 'd like to leave you with a glimpse that takes us back to the world of imagery . This is a system called TAMPER , which is a slightly whimsical look at what the future of editing and media manipulation systems might be . We at Oblong believe that media should be accessible in much more fine-grained form . So we have a large number of movies stuck inside here . And let 's just pick out a few elements . We can zip through them as a possibility . We can grab elements off the front , where upon they reanimate , come to life , and drag them down onto the table here . We 'll go over to Jacques Tati here and grab our blue friend and put him down on the table as well . We may need more than one . And we probably need , well , we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest . ( Laughter ) Yeah , let 's take that one . ( Laughter ) You see , cowboys and French farce people do n't go well together , and the system knows that . Let me leave with one final thought , and that is that one of the greatest English language writers of the last three decades suggested that great art is always a gift . And he was n ' t talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 , or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks to buy the stolen Vermeer ; he was talking about the circumstances of its creation and of its existence . And I think that it 's time that we asked for the same from technology . Technology is capable of expressing and being imbued with a certain generosity , and we need to demand that , in fact . For some of this kind of technology , ground center is a combination of design , which is crucially important . We ca n ' t have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start . And , as well , of efficacy , agency . We 're , as human beings , the creatures that create , and we should make sure our machines aid us in that task and are built in that same image . So I will leave you with that . Thank you . ( Applause ) Chris Anderson : So to ask the obvious question -- actually this is from Bill Gates -- when ? ( John Underkoffler : When ? ) CA : When real ? When for us , not just in a lab and on a stage ? Can it be for every man , or is this just for corporations and movie producers ? JU : No , it has to be for every human being . That 's our goal entirely . We wo n ' t have succeeded unless we take that next big step . I mean it 's been 25 years . Can there really be only one interface ? There ca n ' t . CA : But does that mean that , at your desk or in your home , you need projectors , cameras ? You know , how can it work ? JU : No , this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display . It 'll be built into architecture . The gloves go away in a matter of months or years . So this is the inevitability about it . CA : So , in your mind , five years time , someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface ? JU : I think in five years time when you buy a computer , you 'll get this . CA : Well that 's cool . ( Applause ) The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used . What do you think , what in your mind is the first killer app for this ? JU : That 's a good question , and we ask ourselves that every day . At the moment , our early-adopter customers -- and these systems are deployed out in the real world -- do all the big data intensive , data heavy problems with it . So , whether it 's logistics and supply chain management or natural gas and resource extraction , financial services , pharmaceuticals , bioinformatics , those are the topics right now , but that 's not a killer app . And I understand what you 're asking . CA : C ' mon , c ' mon . Martial arts , games . C ' mon . ( Laughter ) John , thank you for making science-fiction real . JU : It 's been a great pleasure .

"Greek withdrawal from the eurozone "" Grexit "" redirects here . For the software formerly known as GrexIt , see Hiver ( software ) . The Greek withdrawal from the eurozone is the potential exit of Greece from the eurozone , primarily for the country to deal with its government-debt crisis . This conjecture is often referred to as "" Grexit "" , a portmanteau combining the English words "" Greek "" and "" exit "" . The term "" Graccident "" ( accidental Grexit ) was coined for the case that Greece exited the EU and the euro without intention . These terms first came into use in 2012 and have been revitalised at each of the bailouts made available to Greece since then . Proponents of the proposal argue that leaving the euro and reintroducing the drachma would dramatically boost exports and tourism and while discouraging expensive imports and thereby give the Greek economy the possibility to recover and stand on its own feet . Opponents argue that the proposal would impose excessive hardship on the Greek people , as the short-term effects would be a significant consumption and wealth reduction for the Greek population . This may cause civil unrest in Greece and harm the reputation of the eurozone . Additionally , it could cause Greece to align more with non-EU states . The term ' Grexit ' was coined by the Citigroup economist Ebrahim Rahbari and was introduced by Rahbari and Citigroup's Global Chief Economist Willem H. Buiter on 6 February 2012 . After the announcement of the bailout referendum on 27 June 2015 speculation rose . That day BBC News reported that "" default appears inevitable "" , though it later removed the online statement . On 29 June 2015 it was announced that Greek banks would remain closed all week , cash withdrawals from banks would be limited to € 60 per day , and international money transfers would be limited to urgent pre-approved commercial transfers . The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) admitted that its forecast about Greek economy was too optimistic : in 2010 it described Greece's first bailout programme as a holding operation that gave the eurozone time to build a firewall to protect other vulnerable members , but in 2012 the unemployment rate of Greece became about 25 percent , compared to IMF's projection of about 15 percent . IMF conceded that it underestimated the damage that austerity programmes would do to the Greek economy , adding that , in terms of Greece's debt , IMF should have considered a debt restructuring earlier . As can be seen from the Figure A , IMF's forecast in the 2010 standby agreement said that the Southern European country would start to grow in real terms after 2011 . But in fact the economy continued to shrink , and Greek real GDP in 2013 was about 76 percent of that in 2008 . In mid-May 2012 , the financial crisis in Greece and the impossibility of forming a new government after elections led to strong speculation that Greece would leave the eurozone shortly . This phenomenon had already become known as "" Grexit "" . Economists who favour this approach to solve the Greek debt crisis argue that a default is unavoidable for Greece in the long term , and that a delay in organising an orderly default ( by lending Greece more money throughout a few more years ) would just wind up hurting EU lenders and neighbouring European countries even more . Fiscal austerity or a euro exit is the alternative to accepting differentiated government bond yields within the Euro Area . If Greece remains in the euro while accepting higher bond yields , reflecting its high government deficit , then high interest rates would dampen demand , raise savings and slow the economy . An improved trade performance and less reliance on foreign capital would be the result . The implementation of Grexit would have to occur "" within days or even hours of the decision being made "" due to the high volatility that would result . It would have to be timed at one of the public holidays in Greece . One US economist has argued that the legal grounds upon which the "" troika , "" composed by the EU Commission , the European Central Bank and the IMF , has pursued the harsh macroeconomic adjustment plans imposed on Greece are shaky , claiming they infringe upon Greece's sovereignty and interfere in the internal affairs of an independent EU nation-state : "" the overt infringements on Greek sovereignty we 're witnessing today , with EU policy makers now double-checking all national data and carefully ' monitoring ' the work of the Greek government sets a dangerous precedent . "" He argues that a withdrawal from the Eurozone would give the Greek government more room for maneuver to conduct public policies propitious for long-term growth and social equity . "" Plan Z "" is the name given to a 2012 plan to enable Greece to withdraw from the eurozone in the event of Greek bank collapse . It was drawn up in absolute secrecy by small teams totalling approximately two dozen officials at the EU Commission ( Brussels ) , the European Central Bank ( Frankfurt ) and the IMF ( Washington ) . Those officials were headed by Jörg Asmussen ( ECB ) , Thomas Wieser ( Euro working group ) , Poul Thomsen ( IMF ) and Marco Buti ( European Commission ) . To prevent premature disclosure no single document was created , no emails were exchanged , and no Greek officials were informed . The plan was based on the 2003 introduction of new dinars into Iraq by the Americans and would have required rebuilding the Greek economy and banking system ab initio , including isolating Greek banks by disconnecting them from the TARGET2 system , closing ATMs , and imposing capital and currency controls . The prospect of Greece leaving the euro and dealing with a devalued drachma prompted many people to start withdrawing their euros from the country's banks . In the nine months to March 2012 deposits in Greek banks had already fallen 13 % to € 160,000,000,000 . A victory for anti-bailout lawmakers in the 17 June 2012 election would likely trigger an even bigger bank run , said Dimitris Mardas , associate professor of economics at the University of Thessaloniiki . Greek authorities , Mardas predicted , would respond by imposing controls on the movement of money for as long as it takes for the panic to subside . Against this plan , a political initiative , the so-called Menoume Europi was founded in 2012 by students in Oxford University , and it spread among Greek students in other European universities . The first demonstration took place in Athens , Syntagma Square in June 2012 in between two major elections that brought to the country political instability and financial insecurity . A Grexit , assuming that it coincided with adoption of a new currency , would require preparation , for example with capacity for banknote stamping or printing a stock of new banknotes . However , information leaking out on such preparations might lead to negative dynamic effects , like bank runs . Conversely , leaving the Eurozone , but retaining the Euro as de facto currency , would avoid the practical issues and relieve the country of the burden of its Eurozone responsibilities . In the event of a new currency being introduced , all banks would close for several days to allow old ( Euro ) banknotes to be stamped to denote that they were now drachmas , and / or a newly printed currency to be distributed to bank branches for distribution to the public when banks reopened . The British money printing company De La Rue was , according to rumours on 18 May 2012 , preparing to print new drachma notes based on old moulds , which De La Rue refused to confirm . The typical time between an order for a new currency being placed and the delivery of the banknotes is about six months . In July 2012 , the Wolfson Economics Prize , a prize for the "" best proposal for a country to leave the European Monetary Union "" , was awarded to a Capital Economics team led by Roger Bootle , for their submission titled "" Leaving the Euro : A Practical Guide . "" The winning proposal argued that a member wishing to exit should introduce a new currency and default on a large part of its debts . The net effect , the proposal claimed , would be positive for growth and prosperity . It also called for keeping the euro for small transactions and for a short period of time after the exit from the eurozone , along with a strict regime of inflation-targeting and tough fiscal rules monitored by "" independent experts "" . The Roger Bootle / Capital Economics plan also suggested that "" key officials "" should meet "" in secret "" one month before the exit is publicly announced , and that eurozone partners and international organisations should be informed "" three days before "" . The judges of the Wolfson Economics Prize found that the winning plan was the "" most credible solution "" to the question of a member state leaving the eurozone . On 29 May 2012 the National Bank of Greece ( not to be confused with the central bank , the Bank of Greece ) warned that "" n exit from the euro would lead to a significant decline in the living standards of Greek citizens . "" According to the announcement , per capita income would fall by 55 % , the new national currency would depreciate by 65 % vis-à-vis the euro , and the recession would deepen to 22 % . Furthermore , unemployment would rise from its current 22 % to 34 % of the work force , and inflation , which was then at 2 % , would soar to 30 % . According to the Greek think-tank Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research ( IOBE ) , a new drachma would lose half or more of its value relative to the euro . This would drive up inflation , and reduce the purchasing power of the average Greek . At the same time , the country's economic output would drop , putting more people out of work where one in five is already unemployed . The prices of imported goods would skyrocket , putting them out of reach for many . Analyst Vangelis Agapitos estimated that inflation under the new drachma would quickly reach 40 to 50 per cent to catch up with the fall in the new currency's value . To stop the falling value of the drachma , interest rates would have to be increased to as high as 30 to 40 per cent , according to Agapitos . People would then be unable to pay off their loans and mortgages and the country's banks would have to be nationalised to stop them from going under , he predicted . IOBE head of research Aggelos Tsakanikas foresaw an increase in crime as a consequence of a Grexit , as people struggled to pay bills . "" We wo n't see tanks in the streets and violence , we wo n't see people starving in the streets , but crime could very well rise "" . The centre-right New Democracy party has accused the leftist SYRIZA of supporting withdrawal from the euro . However , SYRIZA's leader , Alexis Tsipras , has stated that Greece should not leave the eurozone and return to the drachma because "" ... we will have poor people , who have drachmas , and rich people , who will buy everything with euros . "" Public opinion also mostly favours keeping the euro . Of all the political parties which won seats in the parliamentary election in May 2012 , only the Communist KKE expressed support for leaving the euro , and indeed for leaving the European Union . However , its General Secretary , Dimitris Koutsoumpas , pondered : "" The exit from the EU and the euro will be hazardous , a blind alley unless it is combined with a concrete plan , a programme for the economy and society , with a new organization of society , i.e. a socialist society with the socialization of the concentrated means of production , unilateral cancelation of the debt , working class and people's power . "" On 21 August 2015 , 25 MPs from SYRIZA split from the party and formed Popular Unity , which fully supports leaving the euro . In the September 2015 Greek legislative election , the party won only 2.8 % of the popular vote , winning no seats . Both the Greek government and the EU favour Greece staying within the Euro and believe this to be possible . However , some commentators believe an exit is likely . In February 2015 , the former head of the US Federal Reserve , Alan Greenspan , said "" it is just a matter of time "" for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone , and former United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke described it as inevitable . A leaked document reveals that , during informal discussion with one of the European leaders , UK Prime Minister David Cameron suggested that Greece might be better off if it leaves the eurozone . British officials declined to make their comments on the leaked document . Richard Koo , chief economist for Nomura Research Institute , accused IMF and EU of basing their negotiation position on unrealistic assumptions . As Koo pointed out , IMF's argument was that if the austerity programme had been implemented as assumed , no further debt relief would have been needed under 2012 's framework . The EU's argument was that Greece encountered a difficult situation in 2015 because it delayed implementation of structural reforms . Koo said that the argument was highly unrealistic because structural reforms do not work in a short run , adding that the US did not benefit from the Reaganomics structural reforms during Reagan's era . After publishing documents which admit that the southern European country needs debt relief and a moratorium on debt repayment for 30 years , the IMF was only "" slowly beginning to understand "" the Greek economy , said Koo . In January 2015 , speculation about a Greek exit from the eurozone was revived when Michael Fuchs , who is deputy leader of the center-right CDU / CSU faction in the German Bundestag , was quoted on 31 December 2014 : "" The time when we had to rescue Greece is over . There is no more blackmail potential . Greece is not systemically relevant for the euro . "" A following article in the weekly Spiegel citing sources from Wolfgang Schäuble ' s ministry of finance further spurred these speculations . Both German and international media widely interpreted this as the Merkel government tacitly warning Greek voters from voting for SYRIZA in the upcoming legislative election of 25 January 2015 . Germany's largest selling tabloid , the right-wing populist Bild , raised further anger when it compared Greece to an unfair footballer : "" What happens to a footballer who breaks the rules and does a crude foul ? – He leaves the pitch . He is sent off as a punishment . No question . "" The German government's interference in the January 2015 elections in Greece was strongly criticized by leaders of European Parliament groups including Socialists & Democrats ( S & D ) , the liberal ALDE and the Greens / EFA group , when S & D president Gianni Pittella said , "" German right-wing forces trying to act like a sheriff in Greece or any other member states is not only unacceptable but above all wrong . "" It has also been criticized by the German opposition party The Greens ' , with its speaker Simone Peter calling the debate over a Grexit "" highly irresponsible "" . Economists of German Commerzbank said that preventing a Greek exit was still desirable for Germany , since a Greek exit would wipe out billions of euros in European taxpayer money , and "" it would be much easier politically to renegotiate a compromise with Greece , albeit a lame one , and thus maintain the fiction that Greece will pay back its loans at some point in time . "" FTSE "" considers Grexit following the election to be highly unlikely ... "" . On 9 February , UK Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a meeting to discuss any possible ramifications in the event of an exit . According to a Bloomberg report George Osborne said at the meeting of the G-20 finance ministers in Istanbul : "" A Greek exit from the euro would be very difficult for the world economy and potentially very damaging for the European economy . "" In February 2015 , the Russian government stated that it would offer Greece aid but would only provide it in rubles . Kathimerini reported that after 16 February Eurogroup talks Commerzbank AG increased the risk of Greece exiting the euro to 50 % . The expression used by Time for these talks is "" Greece and the Euro Zone dance on the precipice "" . After an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers ( 20 February 2015 ) , European leaders agreed to extend Greece's bailout for further four months . By late June 2015 negotiations on a deal had collapsed , and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called a referendum for 5 July on the revised proposals from the IMF and the EU , which he said that his government would campaign against . The referendum was defeated by a margin of 61 % to 39 % . Eurozone finance ministers have refused to extend the bailout . Questioned on whether the referendum would be a euro-drachma dilemma , Greece's finance minister , Yanis Varoufakis , said that European Treaties make provisions for an exit from the EU but do not make any provisions for an exit from the Eurozone . A referendum as a choice involving exit from the Eurozone would violate EU Treaties and EU Law . A political cartoon of the "" domino effect "" view of a Grexit . Claudia Panseri , head of equity strategy at Société Générale , speculated in late May 2012 that eurozone stocks could plummet up to 50 percent in value if Greece makes a disorderly exit from the eurozone . Bond yields in other European nations could widen 1 percent point to 2 percent points , negatively affecting their ability to service their own sovereign debts . Europe in 2010 accounted for 25 percent of world trade , according to Deutsche Bank . Economic depression within the European economy would ripple worldwide and slow global growth . However , Greece represents just a small fraction – less than 2 per cent – of European gross domestic product ( GDP ) . ... that negotiated withdrawal from the EU would not be legally impossible even prior to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty , and that unilateral withdrawal would undoubtedly be legally controversial ; that , while permissible , a recently enacted exit clause is , prima facie , not in harmony with the rationale of the European unification project and is otherwise problematic , mainly from a legal perspective ; that a Member State's exit from EMU , without a parallel withdrawal from the EU , would be legally inconceivable ; and that , while perhaps feasible through indirect means , a Member State's expulsion from the EU or EMU , would be legally next to impossible . In the legal literature , the question of whether a country can unilaterally leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU is controversial . Jens Dammann has taken the view that under certain conditions , it is possible for a Member State to end its membership in the Eurozone without leaving the European Union .",1,4

How autocomplete works As you type , Google's algorithm predicts and displays search queries based on other users' search activities . In addition , if you 're signed in to your Google Account and have Web History enabled , you may see search queries from relevant searches that you 've done in the past . All of the predicted queries that are shown in the drop-down list have been typed previously by Google users . For certain queries , Google will show separate predictions for just the last few words . Below the word that you 're typing in the search box , you 'll see a smaller drop-down list containing predictions based only on the last words of your query . While each prediction shown in the drop-down list has been typed before by Google users , the combination of your primary text along with the completion may be unique . Predicted queries are algorithmically determined based on a number of purely objective factors ( including popularity of search terms ) without human intervention . The autocomplete data is updated frequently to offer fresh and rising search queries . Does Google exclude any users' searches from autocomplete ? The search queries that you see as part of autocomplete are a reflection of the search activity of all web users . Just like the web , the search queries presented may include silly or strange or surprising terms and phrases . While we always strive to neutrally and objectively reflect the diversity of content on the web ( some good , some objectionable ) , we also apply a narrow set of removal policies for pornography , violence , hate speech , and terms that are frequently used to find content that infringes copyrights . Why do some of the searches seem so strange ? In some cases , there may be a search term that seems surprising to you , but after doing some searching on the web , you may discover that it 's a popular phrase online for some reason that you did n't anticipate . Queries in autocomplete are algorithmically determined based on a number of objective factors ( including search term popularity ) without manual intervention . Why do n't I see any predictions for a particular topic ? If no predicted searches appear for a particular word or topic , it 's likely due to one of the following reasons : The search term is not popular enough . Queries that are n ' t popular are less likely to be useful in autocomplete . A minimum algorithmic threshold for popularity helps us fight spam and improves the likelihood that the search queries you do see are relevant to your search . We also make regionally appropriate adjustments to autocomplete , so the predicted queries that you see on Google Australia ( google . com . au ) or Google France ( google . fr ) may be different from those you see on Google . com . The search term is too fresh . It can take some time for newly popular search terms to consistently appear in autocomplete . While you 'll usually be able to discover new queries within an hour , it can sometimes take a few days to a few weeks for recently popular search queries to start appearing in autocomplete . The search term violates our autocomplete policies . We aim to provide you with relevant search queries , but we exclude a narrow class of search queries related to pornography , violence , hate speech , and copyright infringement . The search term was mistaken for a policy violation . Our policy review process is neither perfect nor instantaneous . There might be occasions where the system aims to exclude a query in one language that would be perfectly fine in another language .

"Schulte's paper (going on DailyTech's account) places great emphasis on the fact that only one paper endorses 'catastrophic climate change'. This is a classic straw man argument. Oreskes' 2004 paper never refers to an imminent catastrophe. Neither do the IPCC nor do the Academies of Science from 11 countries that endorse the consensus position that most of the warming over the last 50 years is likely due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Even more fuss is made over the large percentage of neutral studies. Ironically, Oreskes emphasised the same point in 2004 when she published The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change . Nowadays, earth science papers are rarely found explicitly endorsing plate tectonics as the theory is established and taken for granted. The fact that so many studies on climate change don't bother to endorse the consensus position is significant because scientists have largely moved from what's causing global warming onto discussing details of the problem (eg - how fast, how soon, impacts, etc). What of the 6% of papers that reject AGW? The most appropriate approach would be to see what these papers actually say. Schulte's paper is yet to be published so the full list is not available (please contact me if you have more info). Monckton does mention several studies which one assumes are the ""cream of the crop"". Deltoid also has its readers categorising peer review studies since 2003 . The papers purported to reject the consensus can be divided into several categories: Non-scientific papers Two of the papers conduct no actual scientific research but merely review social aspects of climate science. I'm baffled as to why they would be included other than to ""boost the numbers"": Leiserowitz 2005 asks the question ""Is Climate Change Dangerous?"" It then proceeds to ""describes results from a national study that examined the risk perceptions and connotative meanings of global warming in the American mind"". In other words, it doesn't answer the question ""is climate change dangerous"" - instead it answers ""does the public think climate change is dangerous?"" Gerhard 2004 (published in the American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin) ""summarizes recent scientific progress in climate science and arguments about human influence on climate"". Papers that don't actually reject the consensus Cao 2005 recommends multi-scale modelling techniques to better understand and quantify the carbon cycle. It mentions uncertainties in our understanding of the carbon cycle but doesn't refute the consensus position at all. Lai 2004 suggests internal processes in the ocean may be causing global warming. Paradoxically, it concludes by recommending we ""reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, thus reduce global warming"". More on the ocean... Moser 2005 studies the uncertainties of the impact of rising sea levels in 3 US states. The emphasis is on society's ability to adapt to rising sea levels and contributes no research on the cause of global warming. Bonafide scientific papers rejecting the consensus There are some papers that conduct original research and reject the consensus. It's useful to look at the actual arguments they present to reject AGW: Zhen-Shan 2006 , performs statistical analysis on the temperature record and finds temperature doesn't linearly follow CO2. Looking at global cooling from 1940 to 1970, they conclude ""The global climate warming is not solely affected by the CO2 greenhouse effect"". Ignoring aerosol cooling and solar forcing while failing to recognise that temperature's relationship with CO2 is logarithmic, not linear, are serious failings. More on mid-century global cooling...

"Analysis & Opinion Related Topics The San Onofre Nuclear Generating plant is seen on the shore of the Pacific Ocean in North San Diego County, California March 14, 2011. The plant is owned by Southern California Edison and generates 2,200 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 1.4 million homes. California will experience unthinkable damage when the next powerful quake strikes, probably within 30 years, even though the state prides itself on being on the leading edge of earthquake science. While California nuclear plants are built to withstand earthquakes and shut down when the earth shakes, the Union of Concerned Scientists, which supports nuclear energy to counter global warming, wants tougher safety measures. Credit: Reuters/Mike Blake By Peter Henderson SAN FRANCISCO | Tue Mar 15, 2011 3:27am EDT SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California will experience unthinkable damage when the next powerful quake strikes, probably within 30 years, even though the state prides itself on being on the leading edge of earthquake science. Modern skyscrapers built to the state's now-rigorous building codes might ride out the big jolt that experts say is all but inevitable, but the surviving buildings will tower over a carpet of rubble from older structures that have collapsed. Part of the lesson from the disaster that hit Japan on Friday is that no amount of preparation can fully protect a region such as California that sits on top of fault lines. Even so, critics fear the state may have long skimped on retrofitting older buildings. Yet the cost of cleaning up after a big quake is likely to be much higher than the cost of even the most expensive prevention, they warn. ""Everybody is playing a gamble that something like this won't happen,"" said Dana Buntrock, associate professor of architecture, at the University of California, Berkeley. Buntrock, like many others, sees California's past as a present danger. The university is spending more than $300 million to retrofit and renovate its ancient sports stadium, tucked into the hills overlooking the bay. ""There are places where two walls that were aligned in the 1920s have moved a half meter apart,"" she said. But the steps that the school is taking are not as common in California as the overwhelming risks might suggest. The concrete high-rises that rose in the years after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were made without adequate reinforcing steel, while homes and apartment complexes that are built atop of ground-floor parking lots are among the most vulnerable structures in the state. Japan's 8.9 earthquake and the tsunami it unleashed destroyed entire villages and left 10,000 or more dead. That sends shivers up the spines of the engineers and architects who follow California's strategy to withstand a big quake that experts say will surely hit the state one day. ""The question is not if but when Southern California will be hit by a major earthquake -- one so damaging that it will permanently change lives and livelihoods in the region,"" according to a 2008 study by the United States Geological Survey study. It predicted 2,000 deaths and $200 billion in damage from a 7.8 southern California quake on the San Andreas Fault. Geologists say a big earthquake in California would probably top out at a magnitude 8 as the state's fault structures are different from Japan's. A quake of the 7.8 magnitude in the USGS study would have about 30 times less power than the one that struck Japan. Forecasters in 2008 saw a 99 percent chance of a 6.7 magnitude quake within three decades, and 46 percent chance of a 7.5 or greater, with Southern California the likely center. A monster California quake of magnitude 8 had only about a 4 percent probability -- except in far Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. That area has a 10 percent chance of experiencing a magnitude 8 to 9 quake -- Japan-sized -- in the next 30 years. A repeat of San Francisco's 7.9 magnitude quake in 1906 could take up to about 900 lives, injure thousands and destroy 3,000 residential buildings, a recent report for the city found. Even a smaller 7.2 quake would cause $30 billion in building damage, $10 billion more in additional costs -- and if fires sweep the city, damage could rise by $4 billion, the report sponsored by the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection concluded. About 27,000 of the city's 160,000 buildings would become unsafe to occupy. One of the authors of the report, geotechnical engineer Thomas Tobin, reflected that the hot winds of Santa Ana winds blowing from the desert into Los Angeles could intensify a disaster created by a southern California quake. ""If it happens to be a large earthquake on a hot, dry day with the wind blowing, the losses could be huge,"" he said. COLLAPSING BOX Tobin lists several types of ""killer buildings"" that would sustain the most damage in a California temblor, including older high rises and complexes featuring ground-floor parking: * Most ""tall, beautiful older buildings"" built before 1980 that dot the San Francisco skyline were made without reinforcing steel, Tobin said. * ""Soft story"" buildings with a ground-floor open garage or retail space also lack adequate bracing. The sturdier box of the upper floors likely would come crashing down on the ""soft story."" * ""Tilt up"" buildings of concrete slab that are pushed upright to create a big box, such as for a grocery store, are among the most vulnerable. Some localities have mandated relatively low-cost reinforcement. Tobin says San Francisco has not. * Unreinforced brick buildings would collapse easily. Some of the fixes for such structures are relatively inexpensive, such as tying together tilt-up buildings, he said. So-called ""soft story"" apartment buildings with five units would cost $10,000 to $20,000 per apartment to fix. Local governments can offer powerful financial incentives to encourage landlords to make changes, he said, but most don't. That said, shoring up high rises is pricey, Tobin allows, and retrofitting has been inconsistent. While California nuclear plants are built to withstand earthquakes and shut down when the earth shakes, the Union of Concerned Scientists, which supports nuclear energy to counter global warming, wants tougher safety measures. PAST PERFORMANCE Japan's experience suggests that even the best preparations are no match for the power of nature. Matthew Hornbach, a geophysicist research associate at the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, said he was shocked by the scale of disaster across the Pacific. ""You don't get better prepared than Japan and to see what's going on there now is, I think, a real wake-up call, really, to the U.S.,"" he said. California and Japan tend to track each other in requirements for new buildings, but Japan tends to tear down and rebuild frequently, leaving them with a much smaller stock of older buildings, said UC Berkeley's Buntrock. California's history of repairing quake damage varies. Former California Governor Pete Wilson said that he waved environmental and other regulations after the 1994 Northridge earthquake - magnitude 6.7. As a result, he managed to get the Los Angeles U.S. 10 highway, the worlds' busiest road, up and running in two months, versus some estimates of two years. But the Bay Bridge, which partially collapsed in the 7.1 Loma Prieta quake that shook the San Francisco Bay Area five years earlier is still being replaced, said Randy Rentschler, director of legislation and public affairs at the San Francisco-area Metropolitan Transportation Commission. ""One lesson that we can give them (Japan) is how not to do it,"" Rentschler said. ""It took us how many years to do the Bay Bridge? - and it's still under construction,"" he added. Aside from the obvious issue of cost, Rentschler said that debate over what to do slowed improvements. ""Local citizens' groups were raising hell about all kinds of things, and they were permitted to get away with it,"" he said. The replacement for the damaged span of the two-part bridge is set to open in 2013 and engineers say it is designed to withstand an event that occurs once every 1,500 years. A final lesson from Japan is that the cities are not necessarily the most vulnerable areas. Rural areas of Japan closest to Friday's quake were destroyed by tsunamis while Tokyo fared much better. Frank Vernon, a geophysics professor and seismology specialist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, described a similar fault far from San Francisco, hundreds of miles up the West Coast. ""The most important lesson in the U.S. and North America is the reminder that we have a similar subduction zone called Cascadia up on the coast of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon and very northern California which could do the same thing,"" he said. ""Some day we will be having this same type of earthquake near our shores,"" he said. Our geologists are kidding themselves if they think A 7.8 earthquake in Southern California is going to cost only 2,000 lives. Japan has the world's most advanced early warning system that shuts down railways, elevators, and other infrastructure right before the 9.0 hit and it still killed over 3,000 (and estimated 10k+). That earthquake was 240 miles away in the Ocean and 20 km deep. You think the San Andreas, which is right near the surface is going to be the same? We're not even close to being as prepared as they are. We have the most advanced detectors... but that's about it. We are wholly unprepared for this. The OC Registers quotes Southern California Edison that their nuke plant at San Onofre is ""safe."" Edison says, ""It was built to withstand an earthquake of 7.0 magnitude, and its sea wall was built 30 feet high -- to withstand a tsunami of 25 feet, which is the biggest that experts predicted would surge its way when the plant was designed and built in the late 1970s and early 1980s."" Hey, a 7 magnitude is what the Japanese planned for, too! And guess what happened? It was a 9 magnitude! Good thing you can psychically predict the upper limit on a tsunami, as well. Seriously, shut down the nukes before you people ruin California with 600 years of radioactivity ala Sendai. All well and good about the earth quakes but the major devastation came from the sea. I am a builder and I know California and Japan build well for earthquakes using the latest technologies -- The areas in this country that should be worried are the Madrid fault and the Northeast where there are no stringent earthquake codes. California will make it with less damage than a major hurricane or tornado. What concerns me is what can be done to control waves and build for Tsunami's. ",4,4

"The statement is justified on the basis that 'the politics must fit the science and not the other way round' (' Don't give up on 2C [PDF -NO LONGER AVAILABLE] '). On the face of it, this seems a perfectly sensible approach. The trouble is that the science doesn't actually say that mitigation is a better strategy than adaptation, let alone whether an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 is better than a 60% reduction. Mitigation, far from being a no-brainer is a complicated and controversial field scientifically. By claiming that their 80% figure is derived from the science, the Tories are hoisted by their own petard -- this is a clear case of the science being stretched to fit the politics. Moreover, mitigation policies cannot be a matter for science alone; they must also be informed by moral and political considerations. And yet when parties hide behind claims that their policies are derived from the science, these are necessarily excluded from the discussion. For example, in a recent article in Nature called ' Lifting the taboo on adaptation ', Roger Pielke Jr, Gwyn Prins, Steve Rayner and Daniel Sarewitz argued that the case for adaptation had not been sufficiently heard. Yet policy-makers need to understand the limitations of mitigation for reducing vulnerabilities, and give more urgent consideration to broader adaptation policies -- such as improved management of coastal zones and water resources -- that will enhance societal resilience to future climate impacts regardless of their cause. To define adaptation as a cost of failed mitigation is to expose millions of poor people in compromised ecosystems to the very dangers that climate policy seeks to avoid. So why would the Tories wish to exclude discussion of alternative strategies? Why would they claim that alternatives would contradict the science, that they are 'at the margin of the debate', and that 'we cannot risk them being wrong'? The answer is simple: lacking a framework of political principles, they have such little scope to set themselves apart from their Labour and Liberal (and for that matter, Green) counterparts that their only option for demonstrating their fitness for leadership is to appear to be taking the issue more seriously. And that's the only option open to their counterparts, too. The result is an escalation of the 'crisis' that ends up looking more like the razor wars than politics. Cynics on both sides of the issue may dismiss Cameron's words as empty rhetoric, as mere postures assumed to embarrass the Labour Party, and to rob the liberals and the Greens of their environmentalist edge. They may well be right, but what is important here is to recognise how dramatically environmental thinking is narrowing political discussion about the future. Crisis politics dominates thinking right across the political spectrum and hides politics behind scientific absolutes which simply do not exist, and cannot be interrogated. Even the Socialist Workers Party is getting in on the act, calling for cuts of ' at least 80 percent [...] by 2030 '. That all parties are pushing in the same direction on this one might lead some to argue that they can't all be wrong. But it would be more true to say that they can't all be correct. Discussions about the future are being reduced to an arms race of gimmicks that appeal to the very same fear that they generate. It's enough to make five blades in a disposable razor seem like a positively radical, world-changing idea. 2 Responses to ""In Crisis Politics, the Only Way Is Up"" [...] kind of alarmism is the way the magazine thinks the masses will be roused. But as we pointed out yesterday, there is little difference between the ways in which the left and the right stretch scientific [...] ",5,5
"Al Jazeera Maps Water Flashpoints Around the World Historically, the concept of ""water wars"" -- inter-state wars fought solely over water -- has been fairly unsubstantiated. But continued population growth, accelerating development, and environmental changes are making water more scarce and in turn increasing the chances of related tensions and violence. To illustrate the growing role water plays in tensions around the world, Al Jazeera has put together a map linked to a series of stories they've done on water ""flashpoints."" Where's the Conflict? Though the map title is ""water wars,"" the highlighted stories are referred to as ""flashpoints"" -- potential points of future conflict -- which is more accurate. They range from protests over privatization in Bolivia and India to unequal distribution in Gaza and Colombia . Some are about issues only tangentially related to water, like the murder of Brazilian environmentalists who fought to protect the rainforest. Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia face severe water scarcity. There is simply not enough water to support many ongoing agricultural activities, like cotton farming for example, in these regions. Yemen is predicted by many to be the first modern nation to literally run out of water, in part due to cultivation of qat , a mild narcotic, but also because of high population growth . While the map nicely collects a number of articles about water-related challenges, the naming is unfortunate. Water experts have tried to move the dialogue away from the concept of water wars. At the National Conference on Science, Policy, and the Environment last year, for example, Carl Bruch of the Environmental Law Institute said that inter-state conflict over water is ""highly unlikely."" ""It's a question of governance,"" Bruch said . He pointed to the conflict in Darfur in 2003 as an example; the entire Sahel was low on rainfall, but only the region with the least capable government and a host of other challenges experienced conflict. In other words, water scarcity is not enough to cause conflict on its own. In fact, countries tend to collaborate over water, not fight. Historical data backs up this claim. Aaron Wolfe and Peter Gleick have noted the rarity of water conflict, and a study by Norwegian researchers Wenche Hauge and Tanja Ellingsen also notes that factors like population density and economic development better predict conflict than scarcity of natural resources. Despite the rarity of international water conflict to date, however, access to potable water is still a n enormous global challenge. Over one billion people lack access to clean drinking water , and increasing consumption and population have already put unprecedented strain on much of the world's water supplies. Demand will only increase in the coming decades, and Al Jazeera's map shows that these challenges are not isolated; water is impacting livelihoods and tensions the world over. ",4,4
"Michael Yardy anchored Sussex 's 355 for eight with an unbeaten hundred which spanned almost the whole of the first day against Kent at Hove . The stoic left-hander came in to face the second ball of this Liverpool Victoria Division One match - after Sussex had lost Richard Montgomerie for nought - and remained an immovable object until stumps . Yardy ( 126 not out ) faced 298 balls and managed 13 fours - his watchfulness a necessary foil to the shot-makers who came and went around him , notable among whom was Murray Goodwin ( 82 ) for his domination of a third-wicket stand of 141 . The hosts , who chose to bat first on a sunny morning , closed day one already in possession of four of the seven points they need from this fixture to usurp Lancashire at the top of the table . But as championship cricket returned following the mid-summer Twenty20 break , they could hardly have got off to a worse start when Montgomerie went lbw pushing forward to Amjad Khan . The Kent fast bowler thought he had struck again three balls later , but this time Yardy survived on nought despite a significant appeal for caught behind . He remained in situ on an even batting surface for another six-and-a-half hours , having been heavily outscored in his 29-over association with Goodwin who hit 11 fours and a six in a fluent 108-ball stay . After South Africa seamer Tyron Henderson had opener Carl Hopkinson lbw padding up for a maiden championship wicket , Goodwin was initially circumspect . But the Zimbabwean gradually took the initiative either side of lunch with a clutch of crisp drives down the ground and good runs square of the wicket as well . With Yardy content to continue at his own unhurried tempo , though , Goodwin eventually paid for his adventure . Two balls after hitting Min Patel for a straight six , he again went down the wicket and was unable to regain his ground when the slow left-armer pushed the ball wider and flatter . Chris Adams and Matthew Prior both went cheaply , the captain lbw offering no stroke to Khan and the wicket-keeper becoming Dwayne Bravo's first championship victim when he plonked a drive straight to short extra-cover . When Luke Wright somehow propelled an abortive leg-side thrash at Patel only as far as short mid-off to go for a duck Sussex had lost four wickets for only 44 runs . Yardy was unperturbed , however and - as the likes of Yasir Arafat and Ollie Rayner took transient responsibility for the run rate in a series of handy late-order stands - he inched into three figures by midway through the evening session . Along the way , there was plenty of lapping and sweeping of spinners Patel and James Tredwell as well as canny placement of pace and the occasional full-blooded pull . Yardy's ritual and plentiful movement in the crease against the seamers resulted only in conspicuous strokelessness for long periods once the ball arrived . But when the loose deliveries came his way they were regularly dispatched as he continued his unfussy accumulation . His innings will rarely have anyone on the edge of their Hove deckchairs . Even so this second hundred of an injury-interrupted season could yet prove a springboard for Sussex as they go in search of championship title number two in the second half of the summer .

"The Government should scrap plans to create a new financial enforcement body and hand powers to the Ombudsman -- or risk huge confusion, according to the Adam Smith Institute. A damning paper from the right-wing think tank, seen by The Daily Telegraph , claims the nascent Financial Conduct Authority shows no sign of understanding markets and ""plans to busy itself interfering in City businesses"", which will prove a huge cost to the industry and its customers. The think tank suggests it would be better to terminate the FCA before it gets going and turn over the consumer protection issues it is meant to be looking at to the existing Financial Ombudsman Service, rather than risk overlap. The FCA is supposed to be one of two bodies replacing the Financial Services Authority next year. The other, the Prudential Regulation Authority, is being set up to handle supply-side issues. But the Adam Smith Institute claims there is no need to establish the FCA, which will ""inherit many of the FSA's flaws"" and be as ""incompetent"" as the existing financial watchdog. The Institute's paper slates the FSA for allowing bad practices to flourish under the PPI mis-selling scandal, and then announ-cing ""headline grabbing large fines ... correlated with the time the FSA has been asleep at the wheel"". The remit of the Ombudsman should instead be expanded from consumers and micro-businesses to include all small to medium-sized businesses, the Adam Smith Institute suggests. Related Articles Tim Ambler, co-author on the paper, said: ""The UK needs one body charged with financial services consumer protection, not two, and one body charged with naming the supply-side, namely the PRA."" He added: ""The proposed FCA will do nothing that the Ombudsman and an institute for financial advisers cannot do better. It should be terminated at birth."" Mr Ambler said recent speeches by Martin Wheatley, head of conduct at the FSA and chief executive designate of the FCA, indicate that the new body will just be more of the same. ""He talks of market interventions, restricting choice and, in effect, deciding what is best for consumers without leaving them to decide for themselves and then complaining if they are hard done by,"" he said. Chancellor George Osborne announced in 2010 he would split the FSA into two main new bodies, the FCA and PRA, to improve consumer protection and better police the City and the banking system. ",4,4

Yes, original thread didn't mentioned mosquito net, but since I'm after similar product I did . Thanks anyway, Dana I just researched this subject. There are not too many options on the market. The best option is awning with zip-on mosquito net by Open Sky -- 2500(whole set-up for $590, ~ AU). This set-up can actually be handy during hot nights. Since it can be used as sleep-out but can be installed only on side of your vehicle. Can't be on the back of your car as is not wide enough. Otherwise I haven't found anything better. Let me know in this tread if you will have better success I would be also interested..... Dana I have an ARB awning with the zip on mozzie net and have found it to be great (see my rig pics the "" Exmouth WA"" one). It's basically the same as the Open Sky unit and about the same price. Found the awning easy to put up and take down and seems to stand up to strong winds. Because it comes with adjustable poles you can move the awning up and down to block out the sun. I've also recently bought but not tried out yet, a rear (or side) awning from BCF which is like a half dome tent with the sides cut out, if you know what I mean. It can be either tied or suction cupped to the 4x4. Packs away into a small bag. I bought this one to provide some shade whilst using the swing down table at the rear to make a cuppa etc.. Price $59.60. Hope this helps. Regards, Darren We have one by a company called Gunyah ( http://www.go4x4.com.au/index.htm ). We found them when wandering around one of the 4wd shows and they were the best we saw there. They do them for the back as well as the side. They can go up in almost any weather without needing ropes and pegs which makes them very easy to use. Have a look at the web site to see how easy they are to put up and take down.

Cheers Kev I am a genius in disguise, it's a bloody good disguise...no one would ever know! replied: When one takes the additional fuel consumption into concideration, wind noise, time to set up verses the number of times you'd need their piddly amount of shade or rain coverage I'd question their real worth at times. On a recent Flinders trip our group had several different types and it was pretty unanimus by the laughing when they were being set up that many thought they to be a bit of a novelty. (Look what new assessory I've got/mines bigger than yours ;-) Of the brands there, the ARB seemed the simplist to set up being self supporting unless the wind was blowing. As far as keepng the fridge cooler in the car I'd doubt it would make any noticable difference. Units on the side of the car can be longer and in general are far easier to set up. (2 to 5 min) Ones on the rear give better coverage to where you really need it particually when its wet, for packing up or preparing meals on the tailgate etc. They usually require more poles/pegs to get the same amount of shade area. I've gone with carrying a large L shaped canvas tarp which is clipped to the roof rack around the side and rear. It can be flipped over to cover left or right sides of the car as needed. It's about 20m square in area giving fair dinkum shade or rain coverage and takes 8 to 10 minutes to set up.(Not the sort of thing you'd use for a quick lunch stop). The real usefulness of an awning would be determined by what your needs are. Cheers Craig...........

As mentioned earlier in this thread (ebay awning) I remember you contacted me and I think I threw it in the too costly basket and what I mean by that is I can't compete with the Chinese made stuff, bulk buy and minimum hourly rates) Another problem with the whole mossie net thing is I can't really make it to suit every vehicle (doors and zipper placing, height etc) and I hate things that just don't work or look ugly or make shift. My other problem, the price would obviously increase and I can't see anyone spending $400-$500 or so on an awning and a mozzie net when you can buy an entire tent or three for this price? I started by at actually making an awning for myself as I had problems storing poles (rattles drive me bonkers!) From there, many people asked for them and were happy with the price, quality and simplicity. I thought I would put one or two on ebay and it's been okay so far. Though ebay scares me a little! If you were in Sydney and could bring the Pajero I would look at a design to suit your needs however you are in SA. My advise, take your car to a canvas manufacturer or an upholster of some nature, do your best to explain what you want and if they would like some ideas on design or anything I am happy to help.

"Comments for Post (25) I'm there with you. I've been dealing with a fussy baby for the past 2 days and I asked DH to try to come home early from work because I was going to lose it. I finally get lo to settle down and take a nap I'm my arms and he's fine. When DH gets home and finished eating I ask him to take lo for 15 minutes do I could have me time without him and he says he's going to bed because he has to work his other job tonight... Ok fine, but 15 minutes later what is he doing? Smoking a cigarette outside! I feel if he had time sure that he most definitely had time to give ME a break (short at that) from lo. I seriously want to punch him in his throat right now. I can totally relate as we sometimes have those days. I try to keep my cool & just not do anything for him. Most of the time he's an awesome helper, but since I've been home he's slacking big time. When I worked he coocked, cleaned, did laundry & kept the office & yard clean. Hopefully when I return to work he'll start to help around more again. He will also be caring for LO while I'm at work then he'll head to work. I'm sorry. Men are so clueless sometimes.. My DH has never gotten up with either of our boys. He always says he will, but he needs me to wake him up. If I have to wake up enough to wake you up, I might as well just get up! So frustrating! Communication is the key here. Men often take everything literally. Try to sit him and have a serious talk while keeping cool (I am repeating ans stressing out some of the things previous posters said). I know it is easier said than done. Good luck. What I did a couple of timea when my DH was on his phone playing game for several hours straight while I was running around the house (and he did not take my asking for help seriously), I just left the house for a couple of hours leaving him with both LOs. Needless to say, he was texting me apologizing in about an hour. After these ""experiments"" he is helping now and respects me more. What really killed me is dinner. I don't think it could have been anymore clear as I said ""Im starving can you please make me dinner"" Im never hungry so for me to say Im starving means I haven't eaten all day. So why on earth it took him soo long to make dinner I will never know *btw its now 10pm and I just took my first bite*. I know what he was doing. He was in the kitchen playing games on his phone ignoring dinner completely.... seriously. I am crying eating this sloopy joe. It is cold and rather gross when cold, but I don't have the energy to warm it up. A It might be a communication issue at the heart of this. But I am sick of having to make lists and being the only responsible adult in this house. I average 4 hours of sleep a night trying to keep the house up, working full time, making dinner, caring for my child, and attempting to get anytime for me in. He sleeps 12 hours a night and never does a thing. I don't know how many times I have asked him, begged him, pleaded with him, screamed at him, and cried for him to help. Nothing ever changes. Somedays I think it would be easier to handle if I were a single mom that just had daycare for my girl.

"Drivers cause ' life and death ' 999 delays in Hampshire A fire station had its entrance blocked by a coach while passengers got out for a cigarette . The incident at Rushmoor Fire Station in Hampshire is just one of a number of occasions when emergency vehicles have been delayed by motorists . Fire chiefs are launching a campaign aimed at drivers amid concerns such incidents are on the increase . Photos and videos of obstructing vehicles are being posted as part of the service's # INeedMySpace campaign . Hampshire Fire and Rescue said drivers commonly used its Eastleigh headquarters as a cut-through to avoid traffic lights while others blocked roads and stopped in box junctions outside its fire stations . ' Life and death ' Videos showing drivers crashing into fire engines as they tailgated the emergency vehicles have also been released . Assistant chief officer Andy Bowers said : "" The issue of motorists blocking the paths of emergency services vehicles is worse than ever before . "" Some drivers are parking opposite one another making an entire road inaccessible while others are actually stopping by station exits , often in the hatched areas , and some are even leaving their cars on our grounds . "" On the road we have to deal with motorists who are unsure what to do to allow emergency vehicles to pass , and often slam on their brakes the minute they hear the siren , as well as people who try and tailgate when we have gone past .

"I'm looking to get a Brompton. If I was buying new I'd get the M3L but I was interested in buying a 2nd hand one to save a bit of cash. They really seem to hold their value even for those that are 10+ years old. Does anyone know which significant design changes have been made and what model year? I didn't want to get something from a model year and miss out on a really nice feature had I gone for something 1 model year later. I'd say the most important change was lengthening frame by 20mm in 2004. If buying used it's worth deciding at the outset if you want a rear rack, or not, as it's relatively expensive to add a rack to a non-rack bike as the mudguards need changing as well. The way the steerer joins the main beam was changed (improved?) at sometime - I guess that's the change referred to as longwheel base i.e. 2004 - if it were me I'd steer way from a pre-2004 model. When buying s/h, make sure you see paper-work that gives good evidence of original ownership, say a receipt that ref.s the frame number - Bromptons are v. popular with tea leaves for just the reason the OP identified - high residual values. Thank you all. That's all great advance. The extra length on 2004 or later models is a worthy point as I'm 6' 2"". Am I correct in saying that accessories and extra bits can still be purchased for even if they are for earlier model years? Specifically, I was interested in the extended seat post (or telescopic seat post) to accommodate my height. I will definitely request original paperwork that certifies the cycle is not stolen. However, if it is being sold as 3rd hand (which some cycles are), how can I verify the cycle is not stolen. I suppose I could check it against https://www.bikeregister.com/ but can't think of what else I could do. I'd expect most new owners would have purchased the cycle on a debit or credit card and thus unwilling to depart from their receipt when they come to sell it. If there's any other tips or hints for a buyer of a 2nd hand Brompton then would very much appreciate having it shared. I suspect it may have been covered before so will also do a search. One other question is about the MK1, MK2 version etc. What is the latest MK version number and what year did that MK version start from? Brompton have a bit on their website where you can register your bike frame and serial numbers. I don't know if there's any way of searching that information to check the owner. Perhaps you could get the seller to log in and show you their registration. I guess if the original owner didn't register the bike then there's probably nothing to stop a thief registering it under a fake name so that's not foolproof. EDIT: Also if the owner did register it they can mark it as sold on the Brompton site - which I guess may allow you to register it in your name. If it is etched and/or listed on BikeRegister (which the Met Police bike markers do) - then there is an option for the owner to 'transfer' the registration over. When you list on Bike Register, you can print off a log book. I guess a tea leaf would have to be pretty determined or very sly to go to the lengths of making up an account (as it is only via email), so it isn't foolproof, but equally many users of expensive bikes are listed on there, so it is one option. You can report a serial number/frame number as stolen with Brompton, so it is worth checking their database. ",0,0

"John McCain says he was 'exactly right' in 2008 when he stated Obama was not ready to be commander-in-chief after last TV debate on foreign policy Senator John McCain has said he was 'exactly right' about Barack Obama in 2008 because America's position in the world 'has dramatically deteriorated' over the past four years. Referring to the moment in last night's debate when the President patronised Mitt Romney over his knowledge of the military, McCain said: 'I don't understand why the President wants to take these kind of cheap shots - bayonets and horses? What's that all about?' Speaking to MSNBC he added: 'You know, when I debated then-Senator Obama, I didn't criticise or belittle his lack of experience on national security issues. And he seemed to take these cheap shots. 'Cheap shots': Senator McCain, who went up against Obama in 2008 said his behaviour at the debate last night was 'unpresidential' 'That's not presidential and frankly I kind of resent it because Mitt Romney has had a lot of experience and a lot of know and background on these issues. 'To say that everything's just fine in Iraq was of course one of the great leaps of the imagination, Iraq has gone to hell in a hand-basket al-Qaeda has doubled their presence there, there are al Qaeda training camps in western Iraq. Experience: McCain, pictured here in his Navy uniform in the 1950s, said that he didn't belittle Obama when they faced off in 2008 'And in Syria to say things are just fine after 30,000 people have been massacred and we've basically stood by and watched, and watched what arms to flow in go to the wrong people.' He added: 'Frankly from my point of view I was exactly right about president Obama when I look at the world today as to what it was four years ago our position has dramatically deteriorated.' McCain, who was a bitter foe of Romney's in the 2008 primaries but later made his peace with him after the former Massachusetts governor campaigned tirelessly for him after he won the nomination, said that Romney passed the test in Monday's foreign policy debate in Boca Raton. 'His task was to show the American people that he's perfectly capable of assuming the responsibilities of commander-in-chief. I think he did that.' McCain is to take a bus tour through Florida this week to help shore up the Romney vote in a state that is now looking much more favourable for him. A former U.S. Navy aviator and the son and grandson of admirals, McCain is also expected to weigh in on Obama's mocking of Romney's desire to increase the number of ships. In the debate, Obama said sarcastically: 'You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. 'Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. Right: the former presidential candidate said America's postion in the world had 'dramatically deteriorated' since he took on Obama 'And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips. It's what are our capabilities.' McCain said such attacks were 'cheap shots' and 'small ball'. Romney advisers believe that could also increase the Republican vote in naval areas in swing states, such as Pensacola, Florida and Virginia Beach, Virginia. On his Florida bus tour, McCain will stop at the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum in Fort Pierce and the Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Museum. ",4,4

"Direct Auger recombination causes droop , but its impact can be diminished inserting graded layers into quantum wells to smooth the confining potentials . Calculations by a partnership between at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and the US Naval Research Laboratory show that a ' softer ' potential reduces Auger recombination , leading to an increase in LED efficiency . The debate over the origin of LED droop has taken yet another twist , with a partnership between researchers at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and the US Naval Research Laboratory claiming that direct Auger recombination is to blame . This view is at odds with that of many other theorists , who account for droop - the reduction in light efficiency as current is cranked up - with either more complex forms of Auger recombination or models involving defects . For example , Chris Van de Walle's computational science group at the University of California , Santa Barbara , claims that the primary causes of droop are Auger-related processes involving phonons and alloy disorder . And a partnership between researchers at Boston University and Politecnico di Torino , Italy , argue that although Auger-related processes contribute to droop , carrier leakage , compositional fluctuations and threading dislocations may also play significant roles . These differences over the cause of droop stem from differences in the structures under study , according to Roman Vaxenburg from Technion-Israel Institute of Technology . He has his co-workers have looked at quantum well structures , while others have focused on calculations for bulk material . "" In general , in bulk material , Auger recombination is not efficient due to strict energy and momentum conservation requirements , "" explains Vaxenburg . "" On the contrary , in quantum-confined systems , such as quantum wells , the momentum conservation requirement if lifted and Auger processes are enhanced . "" Values calculated by the US-Israeli team for the Auger coefficient in quantum wells are in the range 10 -31 - 10 -30 cm 6 s -1 . The structures studied by this team feature symmetric quantum wells , which are found in non-polar LEDs . That does not mean , however , that their findings offer no insights into the vast majority of devices made today , which are polar LEDs grown on c-plane sapphire . "" We expect that the Auger rate will be further accelerated in quantum wells grown in the polar direction , "" says Vaxenburg . For their calculations , he and his co-workers use the well-established Pidgeon and Brown model which was proposed in the 1960s . This is often used for calculating the characteristics of direct bandgap semiconductors with a band-edge at the Gamma point of the Brillouin zone . "" It takes into account the eight band-edge sub-bands , "" explains Vaxenburg . "" Adding more bands will only accelerate the rate of Auger recombination , because it will increase the density of final states . "" The code employed for these calculations has been written from scratch . It is a few tens of thousands of lines long , and when it is run on a powerful personal computer , it takes 8-10 hours to calculate the total Auger recombination rate for a given quantum well . Auger rates have been calculated in a wide variety of InGaN / GaN quantum well structures with different confining potentials . One class of structures features a conventional active region , with In 0.25 Ga 0.75 N barriers surrounding a GaN quantum well with a thickness of either 1.5 nm , 2.0 nm , 2.2 nm or 2.5 nm . Other types of structure under study feature ' softer ' potentials , resulting from the insertion of layers with intermediate compositions . The conclusions of the team should not be questioned due to their assumption of zero temperature . "" At temperatures higher than zero , the Auger rate is expected to accelerate even further , "" says Vaxenburg . Calculations reveal that using 11 layers to form a quantum well , rather than the conventional number , 3 , can lead to a three-fold reduction in the Auger recombination rate . This is claimed to spur a 20 percent increase in LED efficiency , shift droop onset to a higher current density , and reduce the droop development rate at higher current densities . The next goal for the team is to extend their model to include piezolelectric polarization .",1,1
